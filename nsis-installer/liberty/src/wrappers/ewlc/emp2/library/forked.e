class FORKED
	-- A SEPARATED object implemented using POSIX fork.

	-- This is easily done. Yet the address space of the child process, running
	-- the FORKED object is "polluted" by a copy of the working set of the
	-- father process at the momento of fork(). TODO: explain this better, even
	-- with an example.
