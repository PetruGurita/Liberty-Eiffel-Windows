	--
	-- typedef int cairo_bool_t;
	--
	--   cairo_bool_t is used for boolean values. Returns of type cairo_bool_t will
	--   always be either 0 or 1, but testing against these values explicitly is
	--   not encouraged; just use the value as a boolean condition.

	--
	-- typedef struct {
	--     int unused;
	-- } cairo_user_data_key_t;
	--
	--   cairo_user_data_key_t is used for attaching user data to cairo data
	--   structures. The actual contents of the struct is never used, and there is
	--   no need to initialize the object; only the unique address of a
	--   cairo_data_key_t object is used. Typically, you would just use the address
	--   of a static cairo_data_key_t object.
	--
	--   int unused; not used; ignore.

	--
	-- void        (*cairo_destroy_func_t)         (void *data);
	--
	--   cairo_destroy_func_t the type of function which is called when a data
	--   element is destroyed. It is passed the pointer to the data element and
	--   should free any memory and resources allocated for it.
	--
	--   data : The data element being destroyed.
