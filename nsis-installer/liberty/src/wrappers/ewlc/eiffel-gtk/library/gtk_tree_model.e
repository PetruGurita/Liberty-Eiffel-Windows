deferred class GTK_TREE_MODEL
	-- The GtkTreeModel interface defines a generic tree interface for use by the
	-- GtkTreeView widget. It is an abstract interface, and is designed to be
	-- usable with any appropriate data structure. The programmer just has to
	-- implement this interface on their own data type for it to be viewable by a
	-- GtkTreeView widget.

	-- The model is represented as a hierarchical tree of strongly-typed,
	-- columned data. In other words, the model can be seen as a tree where every
	-- node has different values depending on which column is being queried. The
	-- type of data found in a column is determined by using the GType system
	-- (ie. `g_type_int,' `gtk_type_button,' `g_type_pointer,' etc.). The types
	-- are homogeneous per column across all nodes. It is important to note that
	-- this interface only provides a way of examining a model and observing
	-- changes. The implementation of each individual model decides how and if
	-- changes are made.

	-- In order to make life simpler for programmers who do not need to write
	-- their own specialized model, two generic models are provided: the
	-- GtkTreeStore and the GtkListStore. To use these, the developer simply
	-- pushes data into these models as necessary. These models provide the data
	-- structure as well as all appropriate tree interfaces. As a result,
	-- implementing drag and drop, sorting, and storing data is trivial. For the
	-- vast majority of trees and lists, these two models are sufficient.
	
	-- Models are accessed on a node/column level of granularity. One can query
	-- for the value of a model at a certain node and a certain column on that
	-- node. There are two structures used to reference a particular node in a
	-- model. They are the GtkTreePath and the GtkTreeIter. Most of the interface
	-- consists of operations on a GtkTreeIter.

	-- A path is essentially a potential node. It is a location on a model that
	-- may or may not actually correspond to a node on a specific model. The
	-- GtkTreePath struct can be converted into either an array of unsigned
	-- integers or a string. The string form is a list of numbers separated by a
	-- colon. Each number refers to the offset at that level. Thus, the path 0:
	-- refers to the root node and the path "refers" to the fifth child of
	-- the third node.

	-- By contrast, a GtkTreeIter is a reference to a specific node on
	-- a specific model. It is a generic struct with an integer and
	-- three generic pointers. These are filled in by the model in a
	-- model-specific way. One can convert a path to an iterator by
	-- calling `get_new_iterator'. These iterators are the primary way
	-- of accessing a model and are similar to the iterators used by
	-- GtkTextBuffer. They are generally statically allocated on the
	-- stack and only used for a short time. The model interface
	-- defines a set of operations using them for navigating the model.

	-- It is expected that models fill in the iterator with private
	-- data. For example, the GtkListStore model, which is internally a
	-- simple linked list, stores a list node in one of the
	-- pointers. The GtkTreeModelSort stores an array and an offset in
	-- two of the pointers. Additionally, there is an integer
	-- field. This field is generally filled with a unique stamp per
	-- model. This stamp is for catching errors resulting from using
	-- invalid iterators with a model.

	-- The lifecycle of an iterator can be a little confusing at
	-- first. Iterators are expected to always be valid for as long as
	-- the model is unchanged (and doesn't emit a signal). The model is
	-- considered to own all outstanding iterators and nothing needs to
	-- be done to free them from the user's point of
	-- view. Additionally, some models guarantee that an iterator is
	-- valid for as long as the node it refers to is valid (most
	-- notably the GtkTreeStore and GtkListStore). Although generally
	-- uninteresting, as one always has to allow for the case where
	-- iterators do not persist beyond a signal, some very important
	-- performance enhancements were made in the sort model. As a
	-- result, the GTK_TREE_MODEL_ITERS_PERSIST flag was added to
	-- indicate this behavior.
