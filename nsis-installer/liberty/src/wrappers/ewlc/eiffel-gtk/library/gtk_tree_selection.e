class GTK_TREE_SELECTION
	-- The GtkTreeSelection object is a helper object to manage the
	-- selection for a GtkTreeView widget. The GtkTreeSelection object
	-- is automatically created when a new GtkTreeView widget is
	-- created, and cannot exist independentally of this widget. The
	-- primary reason the GtkTreeSelection objects exists is for
	-- cleanliness of code and API. That is, there is no conceptual
	-- reason all these functions could not be methods on the
	-- GtkTreeView widget instead of a separate function.

	-- A GTK_TREE_SELECTION object is obtained from a GTK_TREE_VIEW by
	-- calling `selection'. It can be manipulated to check the
	-- selection status of the tree, as well as select and deselect
	-- individual rows. Selection is done completely view side. As a
	-- result, multiple views of the same model can have completely
	-- different selections. Additionally, you cannot change the
	-- selection of a row on the model that is not currently displayed
	-- by the view without expanding its parents first.

	-- One of the important things to remember when monitoring the
	-- selection of a view is that the "changed" signal is mostly a
	-- hint. That is, it may only emit one signal when a range of rows
	-- is selected. Additionally, it may on occasion emit a "changed"
	-- signal when nothing has happened (mostly as a result of
	-- programmers calling select_row on an already selected row).
