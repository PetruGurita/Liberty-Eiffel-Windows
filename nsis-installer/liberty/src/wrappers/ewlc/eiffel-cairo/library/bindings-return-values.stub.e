	--Multiple return values
	--
	--   There are a number of functions in the cairo API that have multiple out
	--   parameters or in-out parameters. In some languages these can be translated
	--   into multiple return values. In Python, what is:
	--
	-- cairo_user_to_device (cr, &x, &y);
	--
	--   can by mapped to:
	--
	-- (x, y) = cr.user_to_device (cr, x, y);
	--
	--   but many languages don't have provisions for multiple return values, so it
	--   is necessary to introduce auxiliary types. Most of the functions that
	--   require the auxiliary types require a type that would, in C, look like
	--
	-- typedef struct _cairo_point cairo_point_t;
	-- struct _cairo_point {
	--     double x;
	--     double y;
	-- }
	--
	--   The same type should be used both for functions that use a pair of
	--   coordinates as an absolute position, and functions that use a pair of
	--   coordinates as a displacement. While an argument could be made that having
	--   a separate "distance" type is more correct, it is more likely just to
	--   confuse users.
	--
	-- void
	-- cairo_user_to_device (cairo_t *cr, double *x, double *y);
	--
	-- void
	-- cairo_user_to_device_distance (cairo_t *cr, double *dx, double *dy);
	--
	-- void
	-- cairo_device_to_user (cairo_t *cr, double *x, double *y);
	--
	-- void
	-- cairo_device_to_user_distance (cairo_t *cr, double *dx, double *dy);
	--
	-- void
	-- cairo_matrix_transform_distance (cairo_matrix_t *matrix, double *dx, double *dy);
	--
	-- void
	-- cairo_matrix_transform_point (cairo_matrix_t *matrix, double *x, double *y);
	--
	-- void
	-- cairo_get_current_point (cairo_t *cr, double *x, double *y);
	--
	--
	--   There are also a couple of functions that return four values representing
	--   a rectangle. These should be mapped to a "rectangle" type that looks like:
	--
	-- typedef struct _cairo_rectangle cairo_rectangle_t;
	-- struct _cairo_rectangle {
	--     double x;
	--     double y;
	--     double width;
	--     double height;
	-- }
	--
	--   The C function returns the rectangle as a set of two points to facilitate
	--   rounding to integral extents, but this isn't worth adding a "box" type to
	--   go along with the more obvious "rectangle" representation.
	--
	--   Q: Would it make sense here to define a standard cairo_rectangle_round()
	--   method that language bindings should map?
	--
	-- void
	-- cairo_stroke_extents (cairo_t *cr,
	--                       double *x1, double *y1,
	--                       double *x2, double *y2);
	--
	-- void
	-- cairo_fill_extents (cairo_t *cr,
	--                     double *x1, double *y1,
	--                     double *x2, double *y2);
	--
