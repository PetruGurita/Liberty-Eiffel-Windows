deferred class CACHING_FACTORY [ITEM_->WRAPPER]
	-- A factory that retrieves wrappers from a cache, usually a
	-- dictionary; used to implement collection of wrapped objects

inherit
	WRAPPER_FACTORY[ITEM_]

feature {ANY} 
	wrappers: HASHED_DICTIONARY [ITEM_, POINTER]
			-- Dictionary cache storing wrappers; usually used in 
			-- WRAPPER_COLLECTIONs or WRAPPER_DICTIONARY
			-- Key is the address (pointer) to the wrapped C structure,
			-- value is the corresponding Eiffel wrapper. This way you
			-- can get back an already-created Eiffel wrapper. Heirs of
			-- SHARED_C_STRUCT, i.e. G_OBJECT could provide alternative
			-- implementation that will not rely on this dictionary.
