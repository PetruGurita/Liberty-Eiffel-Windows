-- Object Hierarchy

--   GInterface
--    +----GtkTreeDragSource

--   GInterface
--    +----GtkTreeDragDest

-- Known Implementations

-- GtkTreeDragSource is implemented by GtkTreeModelSort, GtkTreeStore, GtkListStore and GtkTreeModelFilter.

-- GtkTreeDragDest is implemented by GtkTreeStore and GtkListStore.
-- Description

-- GTK+ supports Drag-and-Drop in tree views with a high-level and a low-level API.

-- The low-level API consists of the GTK+ DND API, augmented by some treeview utility functions: gtk_tree_view_set_drag_dest_row(), gtk_tree_view_get_drag_dest_row(), gtk_tree_view_get_dest_row_at_pos(), gtk_tree_view_create_row_drag_icon(), gtk_tree_set_row_drag_data() and gtk_tree_get_row_drag_data(). This API leaves a lot of flexibility, but nothing is done automatically, and implementing advanced features like hover-to-open-rows or autoscrolling on top of this API is a lot of work.

-- On the other hand, if you write to the high-level API, then all the bookkeeping of rows is done for you, as well as things like hover-to-open and auto-scroll, but your models have to implement the GtkTreeDragSource and GtkTreeDragDest interfaces.

-- Asks the GtkTreeDragDest to insert a row before the path dest, deriving the contents of the row from selection_data. If dest is outside the tree so that inserting before it is impossible, FALSE will be returned. Also, FALSE may be returned if the new row is not created for some model-specific reason. Should robustly handle a dest no longer found in the model!

-- drag_dest : 	a GtkTreeDragDest
-- dest : 	row to drop in front of
-- selection_data : 	data to drop
-- Returns : 	whether a new row was created before position dest

-- Determines whether a drop is possible before the given dest_path, at the same depth as dest_path. i.e., can we drop the data in selection_data at that location. dest_path does not have to exist; the return value will almost certainly be FALSE if the parent of dest_path doesn't exist, though.

-- dest_path : 	destination row

-- selection_data : 	some GtkSelectionData
-- tree_model : 	a GtkTreeModel
-- path : 	a row in tree_model

-- Obtains a tree_model and path from selection data of target type GTK_TREE_MODEL_ROW. Normally called from a drag_data_received handler. This function can only be used if selection_data originates from the same process that's calling this function, because a pointer to the tree model is being passed around. If you aren't in the same process, then you'll get memory corruption. In the GtkTreeDragDest drag_data_received handler, you can assume that selection data of type GTK_TREE_MODEL_ROW is in from the current process. The returned path must be freed with gtk_tree_path_free().

-- selection_data : 	a GtkSelectionData
-- tree_model : 	a GtkTreeModel
-- path : 	row in tree_model
-- Returns : 	TRUE if selection_data had target type GTK_TREE_MODEL_ROW and is otherwise valid
