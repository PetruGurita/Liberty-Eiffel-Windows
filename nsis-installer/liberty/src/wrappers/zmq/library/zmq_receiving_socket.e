		-- Possible errors
		
		-- * eagain: Non-blocking mode was requested and no messages are available at the moment.

		-- * enotsup: The receive operation is not supported by this socket type.

		-- * efsm: the receive operation cannot be performed on this socket at the moment due to the socket not being in the appropriate state. This error may occur with socket types that switch between several states, such as ZMQ_REP_SOCKET. See the messaging patterns section of 
		-- 	   zmq_socket(3) for more information.
		-- 
		--        ETERM
		-- 	   The 0MQ context associated with the specified socket was terminated.
		-- 
		--        ENOTSOCK
		-- 	   The provided socket was invalid.
		-- 
		--        EINTR
		-- 	   The operation was interrupted by delivery of a signal before a message was available.
		-- 
		--        EFAULT
		-- 	   The message passed to the function was invalid.

	require a_message/=Void

-- Multi-part messages
-- A 0MQ message is composed of 1 or more message parts; each message part is an independent
-- zmq_msg_t in its own right. 0MQ ensures atomic delivery of messages; peers shall receive
-- either all message parts of a message or none at all.
--
-- The total number of message parts is unlimited.
--
-- An application wishing to determine if a message is composed of multiple parts does so by
-- retrieving the value of the ZMQ_RCVMORE socket option on the socket it is receiving the
-- message from. If there are no message parts to follow, or if the message is not composed
-- of multiple parts, ZMQ_RCVMORE shall report a value of zero. Otherwise, ZMQ_RCVMORE shall
-- report a value of 1, indicating that more message parts are to follow.
