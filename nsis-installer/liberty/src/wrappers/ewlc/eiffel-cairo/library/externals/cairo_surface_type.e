deferred class CAIRO_SURFACE_TYPE

	-- cairo_surface_type_t is used to describe the type of a given
	-- surface. The surface types are also known as "backends" or
	-- "surface backends" within cairo.

	-- The type of a surface is determined by the function used to
	-- create it, which will generally be of the form
	-- cairo_type_surface_create, (though see
	-- cairo_surface_create_similar as well).

	-- The surface type can be queried with `type'.

	-- The various cairo_surface functions can be used with surfaces of
	-- any type, but some backends also provide type-specific functions
	-- that must only be called with a surface of the appropriate
	-- type. These functions have names that begin with
	-- cairo_type_surface such as cairo_image_surface_get_width().

	-- The behavior of calling a type-specific function with a surface
	-- of the wrong type is undefined.

	-- New entries may be added in future versions.
