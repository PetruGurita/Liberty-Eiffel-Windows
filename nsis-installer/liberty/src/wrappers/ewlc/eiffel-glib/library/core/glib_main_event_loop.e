-- Description

-- The main event loop manages all the available sources of events for GLib and GTK+ applications. These events can come from any number of different types of sources such as file descriptors (plain files, pipes or sockets) and timeouts. New types of event sources can also be added using g_source_attach().

-- To allow multiple independent sets of sources to be handled in different threads, each source is associated with a GMainContext. A GMainContext can only be running in a single thread, but sources can be added to it and removed from it from other threads.

-- Each event source is assigned a priority. The default priority, G_PRIORITY_DEFAULT, is 0. Values less than 0 denote higher priorities. Values greater than 0 denote lower priorities. Events from high priority sources are always processed before events from lower priority sources.

-- Idle functions can also be added, and assigned a priority. These will be run whenever no events with a higher priority are ready to be processed.

-- The GMainLoop data type represents a main event loop. A GMainLoop is created with g_main_loop_new(). After adding the initial event sources, g_main_loop_run() is called. This continuously checks for new events from each of the event sources and dispatches them. Finally, the processing of an event from one of the sources leads to a call to g_main_loop_quit() to exit the main loop, and g_main_loop_run() returns.

-- It is possible to create new instances of GMainLoop recursively. This is often used in GTK+ applications when showing modal dialog boxes. Note that event sources are associated with a particular GMainContext, and will be checked and dispatched for all main loops associated with that GMainContext.

-- GTK+ contains wrappers of some of these functions, e.g. gtk_main(), gtk_main_quit() and gtk_events_pending().
-- Creating new sources types

-- One of the unusual features of the GTK+ main loop functionality is that new types of event source can be created and used in addition to the builtin type of event source. A new event source type is used for handling GDK events. A new source type is created by deriving from the GSource structure. The derived type of source is represented by a structure that has the GSource structure as a first element, and other elements specific to the new source type. To create an instance of the new source type, call g_source_new() passing in the size of the derived structure and a table of functions. These GSourceFuncs determine the behavior of the new source types.

-- New source types basically interact with with the main context in two ways. Their prepare function in GSourceFuncs can set a timeout to determine the maximum amount of time that the main loop will sleep before checking the source again. In addition, or as well, the source can add file descriptors to the set that the main context checks using g_source_add_poll().
-- Customizing the main loop iteration

-- Single iterations of a GMainContext can be run with g_main_context_iteration(). In some cases, more detailed control of exactly how the details of the main loop work is desired, for instance, when integrating the GMainLoop with an external main loop. In such cases, you can call the component functions of g_main_context_iteration() directly. These functions are g_main_context_prepare(), g_main_context_query(), g_main_context_check() and g_main_context_dispatch().

-- The operation of these functions can best be seen in terms of a state diagram, as shown in Figure 1, í°»States of a Main Contextí°….

-- Return value: The main loop recursion level in the current thread

-- Returns : 	the depth of the stack of calls to g_main_context_dispatch() on any GMainContext in the current thread. That is, when called from the toplevel, it gives 0. When called from within a callback from g_main_context_iteration() (or g_main_loop_run(), etc.) it returns 1. When called from within a callback to a recursive call to g_main_context_iterate(), it returns 2. And so forth. This function is useful in a situation like the following: Imagine an extremely simple "garbage collected" system.

-- Example 1. 
-- static GList *free_list; gpointer allocate_memory (gsize size) { gpointer result = g_malloc (size); free_list = g_list_prepend (free_list, result); return result; } void free_allocated_memory (void) { GList *l; for (l = free_list; l; l = l->next); g_free (l->data); g_list_free (free_list); free_list = NULL; } [...] while (TRUE); { g_main_context_iteration (NULL, TRUE); free_allocated_memory(); }
-- This works from an application, however, if you want to do the same thing from a library, it gets more difficult, since you no longer control the main loop. You might think you can simply use an idle function to make the call to free_allocated_memory(), but that doesn't work, since the idle function could be called from a recursive callback. This can be fixed by using g_main_depth()

-- Example 2. 
-- gpointer allocate_memory (gsize size) { FreeListBlock *block = g_new (FreeListBlock, 1);\ block->mem = g_malloc (size); block->depth = g_main_depth(); free_list = g_list_prepend (free_list, block); return block->mem; } void free_allocated_memory (void) { GList *l; int depth = g_main_depth(); for (l = free_list; l; ); { GList *next = l->next; FreeListBlock *block = l->data; if (block->depth > depth) { g_free (block->mem); g_free (block); free_list = g_list_delete_link (free_list, l); } l = next; } }
-- There is a temptation to use g_main_depth() to solve problems with reentrancy. For instance, while waiting for data to be received from the network in response to a menu item, the menu item might be selected again. It might seem that one could make the menu item's callback return immediately and do nothing if g_main_depth() returns a value greater than 1. However, this should be avoided since the user then sees selecting the menu item do nothing. Furthermore, you'll find yourself adding these checks all over your code, since there are doubtless many, many things that the user could do. Instead, you can use the following techniques:

--    1.

--       Use gtk_widget_set_sensitive() or modal dialogs to prevent the user from interacting with elements while the main loop is recursing.
--    2.

--       Avoid main loop recursion in situations where you can't handle arbitrary callbacks. Instead, structure your code so that you simply return to the main loop and then get called again when there is more work to do.

-- The GSourceFuncs struct contains a table of functions used to handle event sources in a generic manner.
-- prepare 	Called before all the file descriptors are polled. If the source can determine that it is ready here (without waiting for the results of the poll() call) it should return TRUE. It can also return a timeout_ value which should be the maximum timeout (in milliseconds) which should be passed to the poll() call. The actual timeout used will be -1 if all sources returned -1, or it will be the minimum of all the timeout_ values returned which were >= 0.
-- check 	Called after all the file descriptors are polled. The source should return TRUE if it is ready to be dispatched. Note that some time may have passed since the previous prepare function was called, so the source should be checked again here.
-- dispatch 	Called to dispatch the event source, after it has returned TRUE in either its prepare or its check function. The dispatch function is passed in a callback function and data. The callback function may be NULL if the source was never connected to a callback using g_source_set_callback(). The dispatch function should call the callback function with user_data and whatever additional parameters are needed for this type of event source.
-- finalize 	Called when the source is finalized.

-- For idle sources, the prepare and check functions always return TRUE to indicate that the source is always ready to be processed. The prepare function also returns a timeout value of 0 to ensure that the poll() call doesn't block (since that would be time wasted which could have been spent running the idle function).

-- For timeout sources, the prepare and check functions both return TRUE if the timeout interval has expired. The prepare function also returns a timeout value to ensure that the poll() call doesn't block too long and miss the next timeout.

-- For file descriptor sources, the prepare function typically returns FALSE, since it must wait until poll() has been called before it knows whether any events need to be processed. It sets the returned timeout to -1 to indicate that it doesn't mind how long the poll() call blocks. In the check function, it tests the results of the poll() call to see if the required condition has been met, and returns TRUE if so.

-- source : 	a GSource
-- can_recurse : 	whether recursion is allowed for this source
-- g_source_get_can_recurse ()

-- Sets the callback function for a source. The callback for a source is called from the source's dispatch function.

-- The exact type of func depends on the type of source; ie. you should not count on func being called with data as its first parameter.

-- Typically, you won't use this function. Instead use functions specific to the type of source you are using.

-- source : 	the source
-- func : 	a callback function
-- data : 	the data to pass to callback function
-- notify : 	a function to call when data is no longer in use, or NULL.
-- GSourceFunc ()

-- Sets the callback function storing the data as a refcounted callback "object". This is used internally. Note that calling g_source_set_callback_indirect() assumes an initial reference count on callback_data, and thus callback_funcs->unref will eventually be called once more than callback_funcs->ref.

-- source : 	the source
-- callback_data : 	pointer to callback data "object"
-- callback_funcs : 	functions for reference counting callback_data and getting the callback and data

-- Adds a file descriptor to the set of file descriptors polled for this source. This is usually combined with g_source_new() to add an event source. The event source's check function will typically test the revents field in the GPollFD struct and return TRUE if events need to be processed.

-- source : 	a GSource

--                                              GTimeVal *timeval);

-- Gets the "current time" to be used when checking this source. The advantage of calling this function over calling g_get_current_time() directly is that when checking multiple sources, GLib can cache a single value instead of having to repeatedly get the system time.

-- source : 	a GSource
-- timeval : 	GTimeVal structure in which to store current time.
