class GTK_TEXT_MARK
	-- You may wish to begin by reading the text widget
	-- conceptual overview which gives an overview of all
	-- the objects and data types related to the text
	-- widget and how they work together.

	-- A GtkTextMark is like a bookmark in a text buffer; it preserves a position
	-- in the text. You can convert the mark to an iterator using
	-- GTK_TEXT_BUFFER's `iter_at_mark'. Unlike iterators, marks remain valid
	-- across buffer mutations, because their behavior is defined when text is
	-- inserted or deleted. When text containing a mark is deleted, the mark
	-- remains in the position originally occupied by the deleted text. When text
	-- is inserted at a mark, a mark with left gravity will be moved to the
	-- beginning of the newly-inserted text, and a mark with right gravity will
	-- be moved to the end.

	-- Marks are reference counted, but the reference count only controls the
	-- validity of the memory; marks can be deleted from the buffer at any time
	-- with GTK_TEXT_BUFFER's `delete_mark'. Once deleted from the buffer, a mark
	-- is essentially useless.

	-- Marks optionally have names; these can be convenient to avoid passing the
	-- GtkTextMark object around.
	
	-- Marks are typically created using the GTK_TEXT_BUFFER's `create_mark'
	-- function.
