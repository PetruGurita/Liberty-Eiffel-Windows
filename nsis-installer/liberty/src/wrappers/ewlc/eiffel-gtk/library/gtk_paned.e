deferred class GTK_PANED
	-- GtkPaned is the base class for widgets with two panes, arranged
	-- either horizontally (GtkHPaned) or vertically (GtkVPaned). Child
	-- widgets are added to the panes of the widget with `pack1' and
	-- `pack2'. The division beween the two children is set by default
	-- from the size requests of the children, but it can be adjusted
	-- by the user.

	-- A paned widget draws a separator between the two child
	-- widgets and a small handle that the user can drag to
	-- adjust the division. It does not draw any relief around
	-- the children or around the separator. (The space in which
	-- the separator is called the gutter.) Often, it is useful
	-- to put each child inside a GtkFrame with the shadow type
	-- set to `gtk_shadow_in' so that the gutter appears as a
	-- ridge.
	
	-- Each child has two options that can be set, resize and
	-- shrink. If resize is true, then when the GtkPaned is resized,
	-- that child will expand or shrink along with the paned widget. If
	-- shrink is true, then when that child can be made smaller than
	-- its requisition by the user. Setting shrink to FALSE allows the
	-- application to set a minimum size. If resize is false for both
	-- children, then this is treated as if resize is true for both
	-- children.
	
	-- The application can set the position of the slider as if it were
	-- set by the user, by calling `set_position'.
