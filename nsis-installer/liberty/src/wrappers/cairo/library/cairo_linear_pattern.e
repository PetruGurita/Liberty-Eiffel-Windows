			-- Create a new linear gradient along the line defined by
			-- (x0, y0) and (x1, y1). Before using the gradient pattern,
			-- a number of color stops should be defined using
			-- `add_color_stop_rgb' or `add_color_stop_rgba'.
		
			-- Note: The coordinates here are in pattern space. For a new
			-- pattern, pattern space is identical to user space, but the
			-- relationship between the spaces can be changed with
			-- `set_matrix'.

			--   y0 :      y coordinate of the start point
			--   x1 :      x coordinate of the end point
			--   y1 :      y coordinate of the end point

			-- cairo_pattern_create_linear returns the newly created
			-- cairo_pattern_t if succesful, or an error pattern in case
			-- of no memory. The caller owns the returned object and
			-- should call cairo_pattern_destroy() when finished with
			-- it. This function will always return a valid pointer, but
			-- if an error occurred the pattern status will be set to an
			-- error.  To inspect the status of a pattern use
			-- cairo_pattern_status().
