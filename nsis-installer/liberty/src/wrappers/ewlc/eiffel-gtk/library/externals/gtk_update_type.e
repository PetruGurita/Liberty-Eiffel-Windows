			-- A GtkWindow can be one of these types. Most things you'd
			-- consider a "window" should have type
			-- `gtk_window_toplevel'; windows with this type are managed
			-- by the window manager and have a frame by default (call
			-- GTK_WINDOW.set_decorated to toggle the frame). Windows
			-- with type 'gtk_window_popup' are ignored by the window
			-- manager; window manager keybindings won't work on them,
			-- the window manager won't decorate the window with a frame,
			-- many GTK+ features that rely on the window manager will
			-- not work (e.g. resize grips and
			-- maximization/minimization). `gtk_window_popup' is used to
			-- implement widgets such as GtkMenu or tooltips that you
			-- normally don't think of as windows per se. Nearly all
			-- windows should be `gtk_window_toplevel'. In particular, do
			-- not use `gtk_window_popup' just to turn off the window
			-- borders; use GTK_WINDOW.set_decorated for that.
