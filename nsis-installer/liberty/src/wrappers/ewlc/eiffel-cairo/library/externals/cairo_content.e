deferred class CAIRO_CONTENT
	-- cairo_content_t is used to describe the content that a surface
	-- will contain, whether color information, alpha information
	-- (translucence vs. opacity), or both.

	-- Note: The large values here are designed to keep cairo_content_t
	-- values distinct from cairo_format_t values so that the
	-- implementation can detect the error if users confuse the two
	-- types.
