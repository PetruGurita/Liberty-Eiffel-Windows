class ZMQ_PUSH_SOCKET
        --            A socket of type ZMQ_PUSH is used by a pipeline node to send messages to downstream pipeline nodes. Messages are load-balanced to all

        --            When a ZMQ_PUSH socket enters an exceptional state due to having reached the high water mark for all downstream nodes, or if there are no
        --            downstream nodes at all, then any zmq_send(3) operations on the socket shall block until the exceptional state ends or at least one downstream
        --            node becomes available for sending; messages are not discarded.
