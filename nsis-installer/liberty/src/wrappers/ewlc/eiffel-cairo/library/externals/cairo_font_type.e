deferred class CAIRO_FONT_TYPE
	-- cairo_font_type_t is used to describe the type of a given font
	-- face or scaled font. The font types are also known as "font
	-- backends" within cairo.

	-- The type of a font face is determined by the function used to
	-- create it, which will generally be of the form
	-- cairo_type_font_face_create. The font face type can be queried
	-- with CAIRO_FONT_FACE.`get_type'

	-- The various cairo_font_face functions can be used with a font
	-- face of any type.

	-- The type of a scaled font is determined by the type of the font
	-- face passed to cairo_scaled_font_create. The scaled font type
	-- can be queried with cairo_scaled_font_get_type()

	-- The various cairo_scaled_font functions can be used with scaled
	-- fonts of any type, but some font backends also provide
	-- type-specific functions that must only be called with a scaled
	-- font of the appropriate type. These functions have names that
	-- begin with cairo_type_scaled_font such as
	-- cairo_ft_scaled_font_lock_face.

	-- The behavior of calling a type-specific function with a scaled
	-- font of the wrong type is undefined.

	-- New entries may be added in future versions.
