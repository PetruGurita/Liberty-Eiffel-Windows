class GTK_ADJUSTMENT
	-- The GtkAdjustment object represents a value which has an
	-- associated lower and upper bound, together with step and page
	-- increments, and a page size. It is used within several GTK+
	-- widgets, including GtkSpinButton, GtkViewport, and GtkRange
	-- (which is a base class for GtkHScrollbar, GtkVScrollbar,
	-- GtkHScale, and GtkVScale).

	-- The GtkAdjustment object does not update the value
	-- itself. Instead it is left up to the owner of the GtkAdjustment
	-- to control the value.

	-- The owner of the GtkAdjustment typically calls the
	-- `value_changed' and `changed' features after changing the value
	-- and its bounds. This results in the emission of the
	-- "value_changed" or "changed" signal respectively.

-- Emitted when one or more of the GtkAdjustment fields have been changed, other than the value field.
-- adjustment : 	the object which received the signal.
-- user_data : 	user data set when the signal handler was connected.
-- The "value-changed" signal

-- void        user_function                  (GtkAdjustment *adjustment, gpointer user_data);

-- Emitted when the GtkAdjustment value field has been changed.
