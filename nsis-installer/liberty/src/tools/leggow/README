LEGGOW - Liberty Eiffel Generator of GObject Wrappers

Most Gobject-based libraries provides enough metadata and introspection nicely
packaged with a comfortable C library to access them. 

It has been written to ease the work of providing scripting languages such as
Python and JavaScript with bindings for all GObject libraries such as Gtk.

This tools uses this library to provide ahead-of-time wappers for Liberty
Eiffel.

The wrappers of the gobject-introspection library are a little special.In fact
the introspection library is written with GObject itself. Trying to generate
the wrappers for this introspection library with leggow would require a
circular dependency so the low level wrappers are generated using the generic
wrappers-generatos and the high-level ones, the classes actually used during
usual programming are written and maintained entirely manually.

Such wrappers are not currently used elsewhere so are kept here, tightly
integrated to provide a self-contained tool, avoiding circular dependencies
