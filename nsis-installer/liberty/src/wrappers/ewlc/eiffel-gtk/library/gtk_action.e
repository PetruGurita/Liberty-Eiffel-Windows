class GTK_ACTION
	-- Actions represent operations that the user can be perform, along
	-- with some information how it should be presented in the
	-- interface. Each action provides methods to create icons, menu
	-- items and toolbar items representing itself.
											
	-- As well as the callback that is called when the action gets
	-- activated, the following also gets associated with the action:

	--     *a name (not translated, for path lookup)
	--     *a label (translated, for display)
	--     *an accelerator
	--     *whether label indicates a stock id
	--     *a tooltip (optional, translated)
	--     *a toolbar label (optional, shorter than label)
	
	-- The action will also have some state information:
	
	--     *visible (shown/hidden)
	--     *sensitive (enabled/disabled)
	
	-- Apart from regular actions, there are toggle actions, which can
	-- be toggled between two states and radio actions, of which only
	-- one in a group can be in the "active" state. Other actions can
	-- be implemented as GtkAction subclasses.
	
	-- Each action can have one or more proxy menu item, toolbar button
	-- or other proxy widgets. Proxies mirror the state of the action
	-- (text label, tooltip, icon, visible, sensitive, etc), and should
	-- change when the action's state changes. When the proxy is
	-- activated, it should activate its action.
