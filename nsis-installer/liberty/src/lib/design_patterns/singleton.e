deferred class SINGLETON
   --
   -- Implementation of the "Singleton" design pattern. The singleton pattern is a property of a type 
   -- (yes TYPE, not class) to have at most one single object created at runtime for the corresponding type.
   --
   -- Usage: insert SINGLETON, that's all.
   --
   -- For examples, look at the tools cluster of Liberty Eiffel.
   --
   -- WARNING: double-check if the object is really a singleton in the conceptual sense.
   --          The singleton pattern is often used in wrong place. See for example:
