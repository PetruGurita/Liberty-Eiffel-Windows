class GTK_CELL_RENDERER_SPIN
	-- GTK_CELL_RENDERER_SPIN renders text in a cell like
	-- GTK_CELL_RENDERER_TEXT from which it is derived. But while
	-- GTK_CELL_RENDERER_TEXT offers a simple entry to edit the text,
	-- GTK_CELL_RENDERER_SPIN offers a GTK_SPIN_BUTTON widget. Of
	-- course, that means that the text has to be parseable as a
	-- floating point number.

	-- The range of the spinbutton is taken from the adjustment
	-- property of the cell renderer, which can be set explicitly or
	-- mapped to a column in the tree model, like all properties of
	-- cell renders. GtkCellRendererSpin also has properties for the
	-- climb rate and the number of digits to display.  Other
	-- GtkSpinButton properties can be set in a handler for the
	-- start-editing signal.

	--   The GtkCellRendererSpin cell renderer was added in GTK+ 2.10.
