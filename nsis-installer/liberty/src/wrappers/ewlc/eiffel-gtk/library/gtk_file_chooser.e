deferred class GTK_FILE_CHOOSER
	-- GtkFileChooser is an interface that can be implemented by file
	-- selection widgets. In GTK+, the main objects that implement this
	-- interface are GtkFileChooserWidget, GtkFileChooserDialog, and
	-- GtkFileChooserButton. You do not need to write an object that
	-- implements the GtkFileChooser interface unless you are trying to
	-- adapt an existing file selector to expose a standard programming
	-- interface.

	-- GtkFileChooser allows for shortcuts to various places in the
	-- filesystem. In the default implementation these are displayed in
	-- the left pane. It may be a bit confusing at first taht these
	-- shortcuts come from various sources and in various flavours, so
	-- lets explain the terminology here:
	
	-- Bookmarks are created by the user, by dragging folders from the
	-- right pane to the left pane, or by using the "Add". Bookmarks
	-- can be renamed and deleted by the user.

	-- Shortcuts can be provided by the application or by the
	-- underlying filesystem abstraction (e.g. both the gnome-vfs and
	-- the Windows filesystems provide "Desktop" shortcuts). Shortcuts
	-- cannot be modified by the user.

	-- Volumes are provided by the underlying filesystem
	-- abstraction. They are the "roots" of the filesystem.
	
	-- File Names and Encodings: When the user is finished selecting
	-- files in a GtkFileChooser, your program can get the selected
	-- names either as filenames or as URIs. For URIs, the normal
	-- escaping rules are applied if the URI contains non-ASCII
	-- characters. However, filenames are always returned in the
	-- character set specified by the G_FILENAME_ENCODING environment
	-- variable. Please see the Glib documentation for more details
	-- about this variable.

	-- Important: This means that while you can pass the result of
	-- gtk_file_chooser_get_filename() to open(2) or fopen(3), you may
	-- not be able to directly set it as the text of a GtkLabel widget
	-- unless you convert it first to UTF-8, which all GTK+ widgets
	-- expect. You should use g_filename_to_utf8() to convert filenames
	-- into strings that can be passed to GTK+ widgets.

	-- Adding a Preview Widget: You can add a custom preview widget to
	-- a file chooser and then get notification about when the preview
	-- needs to be updated. To install a preview widget, use
	-- gtk_file_chooser_set_preview_widget(). Then, connect to the
	-- GtkFileChooser::update-preview signal to get notified when you
	-- need to update the contents of the preview.

	-- Your callback should use gtk_file_chooser_get_preview_filename()
	-- to see what needs previewing. Once you have generated the
	-- preview for the corresponding file, you must call
	-- gtk_file_chooser_set_preview_widget_active() with a boolean flag
	-- that indicates whether your callback could successfully generate
	-- a preview.

	-- TODO: Eiffellize Example 2. Sample Usage
	
	-- {
	--   GtkImage *preview;

	--   ...

	--   preview = gtk_image_new ();

	--   gtk_file_chooser_set_preview_widget (my_file_chooser, preview);
	--   g_signal_connect (my_file_chooser, "update-preview",
	-- 		    G_CALLBACK (update_preview_cb), preview);
	-- }

	-- static void
	-- update_preview_cb (GtkFileChooser *file_chooser, gpointer data)
	-- {
	--   GtkWidget *preview;
	--   char *filename;
	--   GdkPixbuf *pixbuf;
	--   gboolean have_preview;

	--   preview = GTK_WIDGET (data);
	--   filename = gtk_file_chooser_get_preview_filename (file_chooser);

	--   pixbuf = gdk_pixbuf_new_from_file_at_size (filename, 128, 128, NULL);
	--   have_preview = (pixbuf != NULL);
	--   g_free (filename);

	--   gtk_image_set_from_pixbuf (GTK_IMAGE (preview), pixbuf);
	--   if (pixbuf)
	--     gdk_pixbuf_unref (pixbuf);

	--   gtk_file_chooser_set_preview_widget_active (file_chooser, have_preview);
	-- }
	

	-- Adding Extra Widgets

	-- You can add extra widgets to a file chooser to provide options that are not present in the default design. For example, you can add a toggle button to give the user the option to open a file in read-only mode. You can use gtk_file_chooser_set_extra_widget() to insert additional widgets in a file chooser.

	-- TODO: Eiffelize Example 3. Sample Usage

	-- {
	--   GtkWidget *toggle;

	--   ...

	--   toggle = gtk_check_button_new_with_label ("Open file read-only");
	--   gtk_widget_show (toggle);
	--   gtk_file_chooser_set_extra_widget (my_file_chooser, toggle);
	-- }
	

	-- Note

	-- If you want to set more than one extra widget in the file chooser, you can a container such as a GtkVBox or a GtkTable and include your widgets in it. Then, set the container as the whole extra widget.
	-- Key Bindings

	-- Internally, GTK+ implements a file chooser's graphical user interface with the private GtkFileChooserDefaultClass. This widget has several key bindings and their associated signals. This section describes the available key binding signals.

	-- TODO: Eiffellize Example 4. GtkFileChooser key binding example

	-- The default keys that activate the key-binding signals in GtkFileChooserDefaultClass are as follows:
	-- Signal name 	Default key combinations
	-- location-popup 	Control-L; /
	-- up-folder 	Alt-Up[a] ; Backspace
	-- down-folder 	Alt-Down
	-- home-folder 	Alt-Home

	-- [a] Both the individual Up key and the numeric keypad's Up key are supported.

	-- You can change these defaults to something else. For example, to add a Shift modifier to a few of the default bindings, you can include the following fragment in your .gtkrc-2.0 file:

	-- binding "my-own-gtkfilechooser-bindings" {
	-- 	bind "<Alt><Shift>Up" {
	-- 		"up-folder" ()
	-- 	}
	-- 	bind "<Alt><Shift>Down" {
	-- 		"down-folder" ()
	-- 	}
	-- 	bind "<Alt><Shift>Home" {
	-- 		"home-folder" ()
	-- 	}
	-- }
	
	-- class "GtkFileChooserDefault" binding "my-own-gtkfilechooser-bindings"
	
	
	-- The "GtkFileChooserDefault::location-popup" signal
	
	--           void user_function (GtkFileChooserDefault
	--           *chooser, const char *path, gpointer user_data);
	
	
	-- This is used to make the file chooser show a "Location" dialog which the user can use to manually type the name of the file he wishes to select. The path argument is a string that gets put in the text entry for the file name. By default this is bound to Control-L with a path string of "" (the empty string); it is also bound to / with a path string of "/" (a slash): this lets you type / and immediately type a path name.
	-- chooser : 	the object which received the signal.
	-- path : 	default contents for the text entry for the file name
	-- user_data : 	user data set when the signal handler was connected.
	-- Tip
	
	-- You can create your own bindings for the location-popup
	-- signal with custom path strings, and have a crude form of
	-- easily-to-type bookmarks. For example, say you access the
	-- path /home/username/misc very frequently. You could then
	-- create an Alt-M shortcut by including the following in
	-- your .gtkrc-2.0:

	-- binding "misc-shortcut" {
	-- 	bind "<Alt>M" {
	-- 		"location-popup" ("/home/username/misc")
	-- 	}
	-- }
	
	-- class "GtkFileChooserDefault" binding "misc-shortcut"
	

	-- The "GtkFileChooserDefault::up-folder" signal
	
	--           void user_function (GtkFileChooserDefault
	--           *chooser, gpointer user_data);
	
	
	-- This is used to make the file chooser go to the parent of the current folder in the file hierarchy. By default this is bound to Backspace and Alt-Up (the Up key in the numeric keypad also works).
	-- chooser : 	the object which received the signal.
	-- user_data : 	user data set when the signal handler was connected.
	-- The "GtkFileChooserDefault::down-folder" signal
	
	--           void user_function (GtkFileChooserDefault *chooser,
	--                               gpointer user_data);
	
	
	-- This is used to make the file chooser go to a child of the current folder in the file hierarchy. The subfolder that will be used is displayed in the path bar widget of the file chooser. For example, if the path bar is showing "/foo/bar/baz", then this will cause the file chooser to switch to the "baz" subfolder. By default this is bound to Alt-Down (the Down key in the numeric keypad also works).
	-- chooser : 	the object which received the signal.
	-- user_data : 	user data set when the signal handler was connected.
	-- The "GtkFileChooserDefault::home-folder" signal
	
	--           void user_function (GtkFileChooserDefault *chooser,
	--                               gpointer user_data);
	
	
	-- This is used to make the file chooser show the user's home folder in the file list. By default this is bound to Alt-Home (the Home key in the numeric keypad also works).
	-- chooser : 	the object which received the signal.
	-- user_data : 	user data set when the signal handler was connected.

--                                             gpointer user_data);

-- This signal gets emitted whenever it is appropriate to present a confirmation dialog when the user has selected a file name that already exists. The signal only gets emitted when the file chooser is in GTK_FILE_CHOOSER_ACTION_SAVE mode.

-- Most applications just need to turn on the do-overwrite-confirmation property (or call the gtk_file_chooser_set_do_overwrite_confirmation() function), and they will automatically get a stock confirmation dialog. Applications which need to customize this behavior should do that, and also connect to the confirm-overwrite signal.

-- A signal handler for this signal must return a GtkFileChooserConfirmation value, which indicates the action to take. If the handler determines that the user wants to select a different filename, it should return GTK_FILE_CHOOSER_CONFIRMATION_SELECT_AGAIN. If it determines that the user is satisfied with his choice of file name, it should return GTK_FILE_CHOOSER_CONFIRMATION_ACCEPT_FILENAME. On the other hand, if it determines that the stock confirmation dialog should be used, it should return GTK_FILE_CHOOSER_CONFIRMATION_CONFIRM. The following example illustrates this.

-- Example 5. Custom confirmation

-- static GtkFileChooserConfirmation
-- confirm_overwrite_callback (GtkFileChooser *chooser, gpointer data)

--   char *uri;

--   uri = gtk_file_chooser_get_uri (chooser);

--         return GTK_FILE_CHOOSER_CONFIRMATION_ACCEPT_FILENAME;
--       else
--         return GTK_FILE_CHOOSER_CONFIRMATION_SELECT_AGAIN;
--     } else
--       return GTK_FILE_CHOOSER_CONFIRMATION_CONFIRM; /* fall back to the default dialog */
