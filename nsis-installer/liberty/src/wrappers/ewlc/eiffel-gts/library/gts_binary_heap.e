deferred class GTS_BINARY_HEAP [ITEM -> COMPARABLE_SHARED_C_STRUCT]
	-- Binary heaps: efficient data structure for priorit heaps.

	-- The basic operations `insert_item' and `remove_top' are
	-- performed in O(log n) time. Calling `freeze', inserting elements
	-- using `insert_item' and calling `thaw' allows to build the
	-- binary heap in O(n) time.

	-- TODO: is this wrapper class really shared?
	
	-- Note: unfinished.
