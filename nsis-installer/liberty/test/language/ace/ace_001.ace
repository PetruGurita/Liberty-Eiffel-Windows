cluster
   -- In this simple example, a cluster is a simple directory path.
        -- The compiler will only search Eiffel source code in the following
        -- clusters. The order is important, because the first one is the good
        -- one. Also note that one may only use the / character as the
   -- directory separator:
   "."
   "${path_tutorial}"
   "${path_liberty_core}/loadpath.se"
