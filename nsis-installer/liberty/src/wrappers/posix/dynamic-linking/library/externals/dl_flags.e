This flag can also be used to promote the  flags on a library that is already loaded.  For example, a library that was previously loaded with RTLD_LOCAL can be re-opened with RTLD_NOLOAD | RTLD_GLOBAL.  This flag is not specified in POSIX.1-2001.

This means that  a  self- contained  library will use its own symbols in preference to global symbols with the same name contained in libraries that have already been loaded.  This flag is not specified in POSIX.1-2001.
