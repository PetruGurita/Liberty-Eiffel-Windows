	-- This enumeration describes the different interpolation modes that can
	-- be used with the scaling functions. GDK_INTERP_NEAREST is the fastest
	-- scaling method, but has horrible quality when scaling down.
	-- GDK_INTERP_BILINEAR is the best choice if you aren't sure what to
	-- choose, it has a good speed/quality balance.

	gdk_interp_tiles: INTEGER is
			-- This is an accurate simulation of the PostScript image
			-- operator without any interpolation enabled. Each pixel is
			-- rendered as a tiny parallelogram of solid color, the edges
			-- of which are implemented with antialiasing. It resembles
			-- nearest neighbor for enlargement, and bilinear for
			-- reduction.

		end

	gdk_interp_bilinear: INTEGER is
			-- Best quality/speed balance; use this mode by default.
			-- Bilinear interpolation. For enlargement, it is equivalent to
			-- point-sampling the ideal bilinear-interpolated image. For
			-- reduction, it is equivalent to laying down small tiles and
			-- integrating over the coverage area.

	gdk_interp_hyper: INTEGER is
			-- This is the slowest and highest quality reconstruction
			-- function. It is derived from the hyperbolic filters in
			-- Wolberg's "Digital Image Warping", and is formally defined
			-- as the hyperbolic-filter sampling the ideal
			-- hyperbolic-filter interpolated image (the filter is designed
			-- to be idempotent for 1:1 pixel mapping).
