	gtk_window_new (type: INTEGER): POINTER is
			-- Creates a new GtkWindow, which is a toplevel window that
			-- can contain other widgets. Nearly always, the type of the
			-- window should be GTK_WINDOW_TOPLEVEL. If you're
			-- implementing something like a popup menu from scratch
			-- (which is a bad idea, just use GtkMenu), you might use
			-- GTK_WINDOW_POPUP. GTK_WINDOW_POPUP is not for dialogs,
			-- though in some other toolkits dialogs are called
			-- "popups". In GTK+, GTK_WINDOW_POPUP means a pop-up menu or
			-- pop-up tooltip. On X11, popup windows are not controlled
			-- by the window manager.  If you simply want an undecorated
			-- window (no window borders), use
			-- gtk_window_set_decorated(), don't use GTK_WINDOW_POPUP.

	gtk_window_set_title (window, title: POINTER) is
			-- Sets the title of the GtkWindow. The title of a window
			-- will be displayed in its title bar; on the X Window
			-- System, the title bar is rendered by the window manager,
			-- so exactly how the title appears to users may vary
			-- according to a user's exact configuration. The title
			-- should help a user distinguish this window from other
			-- windows they may have open. A good title might include the
			-- application name and current document filename, for
			-- example.

	-- calling this function is sort of pointless. However, you may
	-- want to call gtk_window_set_role() on each window in your

			-- window : 	a GtkWindow
			-- Returns : 	TRUE if a widget got activated.

	gtk_window_set_modal (window: POINTER; modal: INTEGER) is
			-- Sets a window modal or non-modal. Modal windows prevent
			-- interaction with other windows in the same application. To
			-- keep modal dialogs on top of main application windows, use
			-- gtk_window_set_transient_for() to make the dialog

	gtk_window_set_default_size (window: POINTER; width, height: INTEGER) is
			-- Sets the default size of a window. If the window's
			-- "natural" size (its size request) is larger than the
			-- default, the default will be ignored. More generally, if
			-- the default size does not obey the geometry hints for the
			-- window (gtk_window_set_geometry_hints() can be used to set
			-- these explicitly), the default size will be clamped to the
			-- nearest permitted size.

			-- Unlike gtk_widget_set_size_request(), which sets a size
			-- request for a widget and thus would keep users from
			-- shrinking the window, this function only sets the initial
			-- size, just as if the user had resized the window
			-- themselves. Users can still shrink the window again as
			-- they normally would. Setting a default size of -1 means to
			-- use the "natural" default size (the size request of the
			-- window).

			-- For more control over a window's initial size and how
			-- resizing works, investigate
			-- gtk_window_set_geometry_hints().

			-- For some uses, gtk_window_resize() is a more appropriate
			-- function. gtk_window_resize() changes the current size of
			-- the window, rather than the size to be used on initial
			-- display. gtk_window_resize() always affects the window
			-- itself, not the geometry widget.

			-- The default size of a window only affects the first time a
			-- window is shown; if a window is hidden and re-shown, it
			-- will remember the size it had prior to hiding, rather than
			-- using the default size.

			-- Windows can't actually be 0x0 in size, they must be at
			-- least 1x1, but passing 0 for width and height is OK,
			-- resulting in a 1x1 default size.

	gtk_window_set_geometry_hints (window, geometry_widget, geometry: POINTER; geom_mask: INTEGER) is
			-- This function sets up hints about how a window can be
			-- resized by the user. You can set a minimum and maximum
			-- size; allowed resize increments (e.g. for xterm, you can
			-- only resize by the size of a character); aspect ratios;

	gtk_window_set_transient_for (window,parent: POINTER) is
			-- Dialog windows should be set transient for the main
			-- application window they were spawned from. This allows
			-- window managers to e.g. keep the dialog on top of the main
			-- window, or center the dialog over the main
			-- window. gtk_dialog_new_with_buttons() and other

			-- If you haven't changed the window gravity, its gravity

			-- gtk_window_get_position() gets the position of the
			-- top-left corner of the window manager frame for the
			-- window. gtk_window_move() sets the position of this same
			-- top-left corner.

			-- gtk_window_get_position() is not 100% reliable because the
			-- X Window System does not specify a way to obtain the
			-- geometry of the decorations placed on a window by the
			-- window manager. Thus GTK+ is using a "best guess" that
			-- works with most window managers.

			-- Moreover, nearly all window managers are historically
			-- broken with respect to their handling of window
			-- gravity. So moving a window to its current position as
			-- returned by gtk_window_get_position() tends to result in
			-- moving the window slightly. Window managers are slowly
			-- getting better over time.

			-- If a window has gravity GDK_GRAVITY_STATIC the window
			-- manager frame is not relevant, and thus
			-- gtk_window_get_position() will always produce accurate
			-- results. However you can't use static gravity to do things
			-- like place a window in a corner of the screen, because
			-- static gravity ignores the window manager decorations.

			-- If you are saving and restoring your application's window
			-- positions, you should know that it's impossible for
			-- applications to do this without getting it somewhat wrong
			-- because applications do not have sufficient knowledge of

	gtk_window_get_size (window, width, height: POINTER) is

			-- onscreen, it returns the size GTK+ will suggest to the
			-- window manager for the initial window size (but this is
			-- not reliably the same as the size the window manager will
			-- actually select). The size obtained by
			-- gtk_window_get_size() is the last size received in a
			-- GdkEventConfigure, that is, GTK+ uses its locally-stored
			-- size, rather than querying the X server for the size. As a
			-- result, if you call gtk_window_resize() then immediately
			-- call gtk_window_get_size(), the size won't have taken
			-- effect yet. After the window manager processes the resize
			-- request, GTK+ receives notification that the size has
			-- changed via a configure event, and the size of the window
			-- gets updated.

			-- Note 1: Nearly any use of this function creates a race
			-- condition, because the size of the window may change
			-- between the time that you get the size and the time that
			-- you perform some action assuming that size is the current
			-- size. To avoid race conditions, connect to
			-- "configure_event" on the window and adjust your
			-- size-dependent state to match the size delivered in the
			-- GdkEventConfigure.
		
			-- Note 2: The returned size does not include the size of the
			-- window manager decorations (aka the window frame or
			-- border). Those are not drawn by GTK+ and GTK+ has no
			-- reliable method of determining their size.

			-- Note 3: If you are getting a window size in order to
			-- position the window onscreen, there may be a better
			-- way. The preferred way is to simply set the window's
			-- semantic type with gtk_window_set_type_hint(), which
			-- allows the window manager to e.g. center dialogs. Also, if
			-- you set the transient parent of dialogs with
			-- gtk_window_set_transient_for() window managers will often
			-- center the dialog over its parent window. It's much
			-- preferred to let the window manager handle these things
			-- rather than doing it yourself, because all apps will
			-- behave consistently and according to user prefs if the
			-- window manager handles it. Also, the window manager can
			-- take the size of the window decorations/border into
			-- account, while your application cannot.

-- Sets up the icon representing a GtkWindow. The icon is used when the window is minimized (also known as iconified). Some window managers or desktop environments may also place it in the window frame, or display it in other contexts.

-- gtk_window_set_icon_list() allows you to pass in the same icon in several hand-drawn sizes. The list should contain the natural sizes your icon is available in; that is, don't scale the image before passing it to GTK+. Scaling is postponed until the last minute, when the desired final size is known, to allow best quality.

-- By passing several sizes, you may improve the final image quality of the icon, by reducing or eliminating automatic image scaling.

-- Recommended sizes to provide: 16x16, 32x32, 48x48 at minimum, and larger images (64x64, 128x128) if you have them.

-- See also gtk_window_set_default_icon_list() to set the icon for all windows in your application in one go.

-- Note that transient windows (those who have been set transient for another window using gtk_window_set_transient_for()) will inherit their icon from their transient parent. So there's no need to explicitly set the icon on transient windows.
