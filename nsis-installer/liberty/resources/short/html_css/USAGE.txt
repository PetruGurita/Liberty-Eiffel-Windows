1. USAGE

(a) Basic Usage

	Copy this directory into $SMARTEIFFEL/short/
	
	You can get the short form in this format using
		short -html_css class_name.e
	The default behavior of short is to print a file to standard output, so
	you will probably want to redirect this to a file, e.g.
		short -html_css class_name.e > class_name.html

	You will then need to copy seshort.css from this directory to the
	same directory where you keep the output, e.g.
		cp $SMARTEIFFEL/short/html_css/seshort.css documentation/seshort.css

(b) Customization

	You can modify the styles in pagestyle.css as desired. The classes
	I implemented in the hooks are:

	CLASSES USED FOR PARAGRAPHS (i.e., <p class="...">)
		section
		tab_comment
		tab_feature
		tab_feature_comment
		tab_contract
		tab_contract_comment
		tab_assertion
	
	CLASSES USED FOR SPANS (i.e., <span class="...">)
		title
		keywords
		comment
		featurename
		classname
		argumentname
		constants
		simple_featurename
		assertiontag
