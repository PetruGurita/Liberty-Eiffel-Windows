    <p>Provides <a href="index/ACE.html">ACE</a> handling and class loading algorithms, including the (in)famous "distance class
      loader". Let's explain how this algorithm works.</p>

    <p>Classes are stored in <a href="index/CLUSTER.html">clusters</a> which are physical directories. Those
      clusters are organized:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>either explicitly via an ACE file,</li>
      <li>or implicitly via configuration files.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>In both cases, clusters are organized in a tree. The interface of this tree is <a
      href="index/CLASSES.html"><tt class="wiki_class_name">CLASSES</tt></a>. The root instance of the tree is a direct instance
      of <a href="index/UNIVERSE.html"><tt class="wiki_class_name">UNIVERSE</tt></a>, which is a <a
      href="index/SINGLETON.html">singleton</a>. Node instances of the tree are direct instances of <a
      href="index/LOADPATH.html"><tt class="wiki_class_name">LOADPATH</tt></a>. Leaf instances, i.e. the ones holding a reference
      to an actual <a href="index/CLUSTER.html">cluster</a>, are direct instances of <a
      href="index/CLASSES_TREE.html"><tt class="wiki_class_name">CLASSES_TREE</tt></a>. Note that both inherit from <a
      href="index/CLUSTERS.html"><tt class="wiki_class_name">CLUSTERS</tt></a>, and technically a <a
      href="index/CLASSES_TREE.html"><tt class="wiki_class_name">CLASSES_TREE</tt></a> is a node that may contain other cluster
      nodes. In fact that's not the case but that could change of course ;-)<p>

    <p><b>How do we load classes</b> now that the tree is built?</p>

    <p>A class is searched starting from <i>who</i> searches it. A "provider" class is always looked for in
    conjunction to its "client". We compute the distance between the client and one or more would-be provider
    classes having the same name, and the <b>closest</b> class is selected.</p>

    <p>The distance is calculated thus:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>The class loader tries to look for the provider class in the same cluster as the client class' and
      below (in the clusters tree). If it find one or more below, it will select the closest in priority and
      stop its lookup.</li>
      <li>Otherwise, it tries again starting from the parent of the client class' cluster... Until reaching
      the Universe. If at that stage no class is found, no class is returned (usually leading to a "class not
      found" error...)</li>
    </ul>
