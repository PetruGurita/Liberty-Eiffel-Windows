class GTK_FILE_CHOOSER_WIDGET
	-- GtkFileChooserWidget is a widget suitable for selecting files.
	-- It is the main building block of a GtkFileChooserDialog. Most
	-- applications will only need to use the latter; you can use
	-- GtkFileChooserWidget as part of a larger window if you have
	-- special needs.

	-- Note that GtkFileChooserWidget does not have any methods of its
	-- own. Instead, you should use the functions that work on a
	-- GtkFileChooser.
