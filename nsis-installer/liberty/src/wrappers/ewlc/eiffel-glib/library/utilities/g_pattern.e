class G_PATTERN
	-- Glob-style pattern matching - matches strings against patterns
	-- containing '*' (wildcard) and '?' (joker).
	
	-- G_PATTERN match a string against a pattern containing '*' and
	-- '?' wildcards with similar semantics as the standard glob()
	-- function: '*' matches an arbitrary, possibly empty, string, '?'
	-- matches an arbitrary character.

	-- Note that in contrast to glob(), the '/' character can be
	-- matched by the wildcards, there are no '[...]' character ranges
	-- and '*' and '?' can not be escaped to include them literally in
	-- a pattern.

	-- When multiple strings must be matched against the same pattern,
	-- it is better to compile the pattern to a GPatternSpec using
	-- `make' and use `match_string' instead of `match_simple'. This
	-- avoids the overhead of repeated pattern compilation.

			-- Note that, if the user code will (possibly) match a string

			-- chances are high that some patterns will require a

			-- provide the reversed string to avoid multiple
			-- constructions thereof in the various calls to
