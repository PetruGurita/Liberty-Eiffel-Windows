deferred class GTK_BOX
	-- Gtkbox is an abstract widget which encapsulates functionallity
	-- for a particular kind of container, one that organizes a
	-- variable number of widgets into a rectangular area. GtkBox
	-- currently has two derived classes, GtkHBox and GtkVBox.

	-- The rectangular area of a GtkBox is organized into either a
	-- single row or a single column of child widgets depending upon
	-- whether the box is of type GtkHBox or GtkVBox,
	-- respectively. Thus, all children of a GtkBox are allocated one
	-- dimension in common, which is the height of a row, or the width
	-- of a column.

	-- GtkBox uses a notion of packing. Packing refers to adding
	-- widgets with reference to a particular position in a
	-- GtkContainer. For a GtkBox, there are two reference positions:
	-- the start and the end of the box. For a GtkVBox, the start is
	-- defined as the top of the box and the end is defined as the
	-- bottom. For a GtkHBox the start is defined as the left side and
	-- the end is defined as the right side.
	
	-- Use repeated calls to `pack_start' to pack widgets into a GtkBox
	-- from start to end. Use `pack_end' to add widgets from
	-- end to start. You may intersperse these calls and add widgets
	-- from both ends of the same GtkBox.

	-- Use `pack_start_defaults' or `pack_end_defaults' to pack widgets
	-- into a GtkBox if you do not need to specify the expand, fill, or
	-- padding attributes of the child to be added.

	-- Because GtkBox is a GtkContainer, you may also use `add' to
	-- insert widgets into the box, and they will be packed as if with
	-- `pack_start_defaults'. Use `remove' to remove widgets from the
	-- GtkBox.

	-- Use `set_homogeneous' and `unset_homogeneous' to specify whether
	-- or not all children of the GtkBox are forced to get the same
	-- amount of space.

	-- Use `set_spacing' to determine how much space will be minimally
	-- placed between all children in the GtkBox.

	-- Use `reorder_child' to move a GtkBox child to a different place
	-- in the box.

	-- Use `set_child_packing_start' and `set_child_packing_end' to
	-- reset the expand, fill, and padding attributes of any GtkBox
	-- child. Use `child_packing' to query these fields.

	pack_start (a_widget: GTK_WIDGET; expand,fill: BOOLEAN; a_padding: INTEGER) is
			-- Add `a_widget' to box, packed with reference to the start
			-- of box. The child is packed after any other child packed
			-- with reference to the start of box.  When `expand' is True
			-- the new child is to be given extra space allocated to
			-- box. The extra space will be divided evenly between all
			-- children of box that use this option. When `fill' is True
			-- the space given to child by the expand option is actually
			-- allocated to child, rather than just padding it. This
			-- parameter has no effect if expand is set to False. A child
			-- is always allocated the full height of a GtkHBox and the
			-- full width of a GtkVBox. This option affects the other
			-- dimension. `padding' is the extra space in pixels to put
			-- between this child and its neighbors, over and above the
			-- global amount specified by spacing in GtkBox-struct. If
			-- child is a widget at one of the reference ends of box,
			-- then padding pixels are also put between child and the
			-- reference edge of box.
