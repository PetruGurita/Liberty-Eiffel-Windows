class GTK_COMBO_BOX_ENTRY
	--A GtkComboBoxEntry is a widget that allows the user to choose
	-- from a list of valid choices or enter a different value. It is
	-- very similar to a GtkComboBox, but it displays the selected
	-- value in an entry to allow modifying it.

	-- In contrast to a GtkComboBox, the underlying model of a
	-- GtkComboBoxEntry must always have a text column (see
	-- `set_text_column'), and the entry will show the content of the
	-- text column in the selected row. To get the text from the entry,
	-- use `active_text'.

	-- The changed signal will be emitted while typing into a
	-- GtkComboBoxEntry, as well as when selecting an item from the
	-- GtkComboBoxEntry's list. Use `active_row' or `active_iter' to
	-- discover whether an item was actually selected from the list.
	       
	-- Connect to the activate signal of the GtkEntry (use `child') to
	-- detect when the user actually finishes entering text.

	-- The convenience API to construct simple text-only GtkComboBoxes
	-- can also be used with GtkComboBoxEntrys which have been
	-- constructed with `with_text_only'.
