	--Fonts
	--
	--   Fonts are once more an area where there is a hierarchy of types:
	--
	-- cairo_font_face_t
	--    cairo_ft_font_face_t
	--    cairo_win32_font_face_t
	-- cairo_scaled_font_t
	--    cairo_ft_scaled_font_t
	--    cairo_win32_scaled_font_t
	--
	--   The methods on the subtypes are, however, not useful without bindings for
	--   fontconfig and FreeType or for the Win32 GDI, so most language bindings
	--   will choose not to bind these types.
	--
	--   The cairo_font_face_set_user_data(), and cairo_font_face_get_user_data()
	--   methods are provided for use in language bindings, and should not be
	--   directly exposed to applications.
