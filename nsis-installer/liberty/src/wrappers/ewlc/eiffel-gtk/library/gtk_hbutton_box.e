class GTK_HBUTTON_BOX
	-- A button box provides a consistent layout of buttons throughout
	-- your application. The layout/spacing can be altered by the
	-- programmer, or if desired, by the user to alter the 'feel' of a
	-- program to a small degree.

	-- Buttons are packed into a button box the same way widgets are
	-- added to any other container, using `add'. You can also use
	-- `pack_start' or `pack_end', but for button boxes both these
	-- functions work just like `add', ie., they pack the button in a
	-- way that depends on the current layout style and on whether the
	-- button has had gtk_button_box_set_child_secondary() called on
	-- it.

	--   The spacing between buttons can be set with gtk_box_set_spacing(). The
	--   arrangement and layout of the buttons can be changed with
	--   gtk_button_box_set_layout().
