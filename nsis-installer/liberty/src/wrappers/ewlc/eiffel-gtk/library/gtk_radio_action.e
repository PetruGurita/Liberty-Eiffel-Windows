			-- Description: A GtkRadioAction is similar to
			-- GtkRadioMenuItem. A number of radio actions can be linked
			-- together so that only one may be active at any one time.

feature {ANY} -- Properties

--   "group"                GtkRadioAction        : Write
--   "value"                gint                  : Read / Write

-- Signals

-- "changed"   void        user_function      (GtkRadioAction *action,
--                                             GtkRadioAction *current,
--                                             gpointer        user_data)      : Run first / No recursion

-- Property Details
-- The "group" property

--   "group"                GtkRadioAction        : Write

-- Sets a new group for a radio action.

-- Since 2.4
-- The "value" property

--   "value"                gint                  : Read / Write

-- The value is an arbitrary integer which can be used as a convenient way to determine which action in the group is currently active in an ::activate or ::changed signal handler. See gtk_radio_action_get_current_value() and GtkRadioActionEntry for convenient ways to get and set this property.

-- Default value: 0

-- Since 2.4
-- Signal Details
-- The "changed" signal

-- void        user_function                  (GtkRadioAction *action,
--                                             GtkRadioAction *current,
--                                             gpointer        user_data)      : Run first / No recursion

-- The ::changed signal is emitted on every member of a radio group when the active member is changed. The signal gets emitted after the ::activate signals for the previous and current active members.

-- action : 	the action on which the signal is emitted
-- current : 	the member of actions group which has just been activated
-- user_data : 	user data set when the signal handler was connected.

-- Since 2.4
