class GI_UNION_INFO
	-- A GObject metadata object representing a union.

	-- A union has methods and fields. Unions can optionally have a
	-- discriminator, which is a field deciding what type of real union
	-- fields

	-- As unions in the C language has fields but not methods this wrapper is
	-- made indexable over its fields throught proper inheritance of INDEXABLE,
	-- while providing indexable-like features over the functions provided.

	-- GI_UNION_INFO could have been made a proper multiple heir of INDEXABLE
	-- but the added complexity of the resulting code would not have brought
	-- any appreciable benefits.
