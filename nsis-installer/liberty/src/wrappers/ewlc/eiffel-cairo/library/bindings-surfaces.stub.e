	--Surfaces
	--
	--   Like patterns, surfaces, which use only the cairo_surface_t type in the C
	--   API should be broken up into a hierarchy of types in a language binding.
	--
	-- cairo_surface_t
	--     cairo_image_surface_t
	--     cairo_atsui_surface_t
	--     cairo_win32_surface_t
	--     cairo_xlib_surface_t
	--     cairo_beos_surface_t
	--
	--
	--   Unlike patterns, the constructors and methods on these types are clearly
	--   named, and can be trivially associated with the appropriate subtype. Many
	--   language bindings will want to avoid binding the platform-specific
	--   subtypes at all, since the methods on these types are not useful without
	--   passing in native C types. Unless there is a language binding for Xlib
	--   available, there is no way to represent a XLib Display * in that language.
	--
	--   This doesn't mean that platform-specific surface types can't be used in a
	--   language binding that doesn't bind the constructor. A very common
	--   situation is to use a cairo language binding in combination with a binding
	--   for a higher level system like the GTK+ widget toolkit. In such a
	--   situation, the higher level toolkit provides ways to get references to
	--   platform specific surfaces.
	--
	--   The cairo_surface_set_user_data(), and cairo_surface_get_user_data()
	--   methods are provided for use in language bindings, and should not be
	--   directly exposed to applications. One example of the use of these
	--   functions in a language binding is creating a binding for:
	--
	-- cairo_surface_t *
	-- cairo_image_surface_create_for_data (unsigned char             *data,
	--                                      cairo_format_t             format,
	--                                      int                        width,
	--                                      int                        height,
	--                                      int                        stride);
	--
	--   The memory block passed in for data must be kept around until the surface
	--   is destroyed, so the language binding must have some way of determining
	--   when that happens. The way to do this is to use the destroy argument to
	--   cairo_surface_set_user_data().
	--
	--   Some languages may not have a suitable "pointer to a block of data" type
	--   to pass in for data. And even where a language does have such a type, the
	--   user will be frequently able to cause the backing store to be reallocated
	--   to a different location or truncated. Should we recommend a standard type
	--   name and binding for a buffer object here?
