			--   the two circles defined by (x0, y0, c0) and (x1, y1,
			--   c0). Before using the gradient pattern, a number of
			--   color stops should be defined using `add_color_stop_rgb'
			--   or `add_color_stop_rgba'.
		
			-- Note: The coordinates here are in pattern space. For a new
			-- pattern, pattern space is identical to user space, but the
			-- relationship between the spaces can be changed with
			-- `set_matrix'.
