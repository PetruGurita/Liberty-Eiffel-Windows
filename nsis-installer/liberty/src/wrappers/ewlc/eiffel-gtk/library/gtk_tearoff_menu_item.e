class GTK_TEAROFF_MENU_ITEM
	-- A GtkTearoffMenuItem is a special GtkMenuItem which is used to
	-- tear off and reattach its menu.  When its menu is shown
	-- normally, the GtkTearoffMenuItem is drawn as a dotted line
	-- indicating that the menu can be torn off. Activating it causes
	-- its menu to be torn off and displayed in its own window as a
	-- tearoff menu.
	
	-- When its menu is shown as a tearoff menu, the GtkTearoffMenuItem
	-- is drawn as a dotted line which has a left pointing arrow
	-- graphic indicating that the tearoff menu can be
	-- reattached. Activating it will erase the tearoff menu window.
