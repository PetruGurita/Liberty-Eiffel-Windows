This cluster - Eiffel-plugin - is an experiment on how to implement plug-in for Eiffel, i.e. loading external libraries providing new functionalities.

It shall not to be confused with the external plugin mechanism.

To further confuse things, this plugins do actually use the external plugin
mechanism.... Or shall we call it PLUGGABLE?
