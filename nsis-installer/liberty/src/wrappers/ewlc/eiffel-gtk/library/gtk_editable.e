			-- The GtkEditable interface is an interface which should be
			-- implemented by text editing widgets, such as GtkEntry and
			-- GtkText. It contains functions for generically
			-- manipulating an editable widget, a large number of action
			-- signals used for key bindings, and several signals that an
			-- application can connect to to modify the behavior of a
			-- widget.

			-- As an example of the latter usage, by connecting the
			-- following handler to "insert_text", an application can
			-- convert all entry into a widget into uppercase.

			-- Example 3. Forcing entry to uppercase.
