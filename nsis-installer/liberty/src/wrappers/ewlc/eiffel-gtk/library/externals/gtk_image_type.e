				-- Describes the image data representation used by a
				-- GtkImage. If you want to get the image from the widget,
				-- you can only get the currently-stored
				-- representation. e.g. if the `GTK_IMAGE.storage_type'
				-- returns GTK_IMAGE_PIXBUF, then you can call
				-- `GTK_IMAGE.pixbuf' but not `GTK_IMAGE.stock'. For empty
				-- images, you can request any storage type (call any of
				-- the "get" functions), but they will all return Void
				-- values.
