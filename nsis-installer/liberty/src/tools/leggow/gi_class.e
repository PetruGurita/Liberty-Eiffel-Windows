deferred class GI_CLASS
	-- Metainformation regarding a GObject introspection class, shared between
	-- GI_OBJECT_INFO and GI_INTERFACE_INFO. A GI_OBJECT_INFO maps to an
	-- effective, unexpanded Eiffel wrapper class while a GI_INTERFACE_INFO
	-- represent a deferred class. 

	-- Both objects and interfaces have methods, properties, signals,
	-- interfaces, constants and virtual functions.

	-- GI_INTERFACE_INFO also has prerequities which as far as I know can be
	-- only other interfaces yet its documetnation says that a prerequisite is
	-- a GI_BASE_INFO which could be just anything.... 

	-- Interfaces and objects actually offer indexed accesed to their
	-- prerequisites, properties, methods, signales, virtual functions and
	-- constants.  

	-- Therefore they should be - at least conceptually - ITERABLE or INDEXABLE
	-- or TRAVERSABLE over GI_FUNCTION_INFO, GI_PROPERTY_INFO, GI_SIGNAL_INFO,
	-- GI_INTERFACE_INFO, GI_CONSTANT_INFO and GI_VFUNC_INFO.

	-- This class should inherit repeatedly six times from TRAVERSABLE; such a
	-- multiple, repeated inheritance tree would make GI_CLASS needlessly
	-- complex as each repeated inheritance would require renaming and
	-- redefining of pratically all the indexable interface (lower, upper,
	-- valid_index, item, first, last, for_each, for_all, exists, aggregate
	-- out_in_tagged_out_memory, count, is_empty)

	-- Given the particular status of this introspection library it seems more
	-- pratical to provide "only" iterators.

	-- The iteration facilities are also expanded classes thus making proper
	-- inheritance from ITERABLE quite a chore. 
	
	-- The iteration features are all made expanded classes to avoid creating a
	-- new object everytime the program needs to iterate over the items
	-- contained into a GI_CLASS. An expanded iterator-like object gives the
	-- efficience of an old-school loop over indexes without bothering about
	-- indexes and off-by-one bugs.

	-- TODO: the documentation og GIR is not consistent as it reads that an interface has fields and interfaces yet it hasn't.
