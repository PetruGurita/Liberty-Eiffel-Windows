class GI_SIGNAL_INFO
	-- A GObject metadata object representing a signal

	-- GI_SIGNAL_INFO represents a signal. It's a sub-struct of GICallableInfo
	-- and contains a set of flags and a class closure.  See GICallableInfo for
	-- information on how to retreive arguments and other metadata from the
	-- signal.
