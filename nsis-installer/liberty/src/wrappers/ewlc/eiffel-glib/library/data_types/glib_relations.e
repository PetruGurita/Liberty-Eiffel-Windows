-- Description

-- A GRelation is a table of data which can be indexed on any number of fields, rather like simple database tables. A GRelation contains a number of records, called tuples. Each record contains a number of fields. Records are not ordered, so it is not possible to find the record at a particular index.

-- Note that GRelation tables are currently limited to 2 fields.

-- To create a GRelation, use g_relation_new().

-- To specify which fields should be indexed, use g_relation_index(). Note that this must be called before any tuples are added to the GRelation.

-- To add records to a GRelation use g_relation_insert().

-- To determine if a given record appears in a GRelation, use g_relation_exists(). Note that fields are compared directly, so pointers must point to the exact same position (i.e. different copies of the same string will not match.)

-- To count the number of records which have a particular value in a given field, use g_relation_count().

-- To get all the records which have a particular value in a given field, use g_relation_select(). To access fields of the resulting records, use g_tuples_index(). To free the resulting records use g_tuples_destroy().

-- To delete all records which have a particular value in a given field, use g_relation_delete().

-- To destroy the GRelation, use g_relation_destroy().

-- To help debug GRelation objects, use g_relation_print().

-- GRelation

-- typedef struct _GRelation GRelation;

-- Inserts a record into a GRelation.

--                                              ...);

-- Returns TRUE if a record with the given values exists in a GRelation. Note that the values are compared directly, so that, for example, two copies of the same string will not match.
-- relation : 	a GRelation.
-- ... : 	the fields of the record to compare. The number must match the number of fields in the GRelation.
-- Returns : 	TRUE if a record matches.

-- key : 	the value to compare with.
-- field : 	the field of each record to match.

-- g_relation_destroy ()

-- relation : 	a GRelation.
-- g_relation_print ()

-- void        g_relation_print                (GRelation *relation);

-- Outputs information about all records in a GRelation, as well as the indexes. It is for debugging.
-- relation : 	a GRelation.
-- GTuples

-- typedef struct {
--   guint len;
-- } GTuples;

-- The GTuples struct is used to return records (or tuples) from the GRelation by g_relation_select(). It only contains one public member - the number of records that matched. To access the matched records, you must use g_tuples_index().
-- guint len; 	the number of records that matched.
-- g_tuples_destroy ()

-- void        g_tuples_destroy                (GTuples *tuples);

-- Frees the records which were returned by g_relation_select(). This should always be called after g_relation_select() when you are finished with the records. The records are not removed from the GRelation.
