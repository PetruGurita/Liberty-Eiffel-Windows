			-- This callback will call FACTORY.`item_from' to build a

			-- `item_from' necessarly belong to FACTORY because
			-- G_COMPARE_DATA_CALLBACK has no knowledge of the effective
			-- type of the wrappers it handle.

			-- G_COMPARE_DATA_CALLBACK cannot be made generic otherwise
			-- we should declare the effective types used in the cecil
			-- file that produce the function called by Glib. A general
			-- callback class will need several version of the same
			-- function - one for each effective usage - when Glib's
			-- callback needs exactly one and only one.

			-- Therefore G_COMPARE_DATA_CALLBACK will call `item_from' on
			-- its coupled FACTORY that will create the effective
			-- wrapper.

			-- Note: feel free to ask Paolo further explanation of
			-- this. 2007-03-04
