deferred class CAIRO_PATTERN_TYPE
	-- cairo_pattern_type_t is used to describe the type of a given pattern.
	
	-- The type of a pattern is determined by the function used to
	-- create it. The cairo_pattern_create_rgb() and
	-- cairo_pattern_create_rgba() functions create SOLID patterns. The
	-- remaining cairo_pattern_create functions map to pattern types in
	-- obvious ways.
	
	-- The pattern type can be queried with cairo_pattern_get_type()
	
	-- Most cairo_pattern functions can be called with a pattern of any
	-- type, (though trying to change the extend or filter for a solid
	-- pattern will have no effect). A notable exception is
	-- cairo_pattern_add_color_stop_rgb() and
	-- cairo_pattern_add_color_stop_rgba() which must only be called
	-- with gradient patterns (either LINEAR or RADIAL). Otherwise the
	-- pattern will be shutdown and put into an error state.
	
	-- New entries may be added in future versions.
