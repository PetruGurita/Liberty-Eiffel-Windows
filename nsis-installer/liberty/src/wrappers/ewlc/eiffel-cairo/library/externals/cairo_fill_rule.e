deferred class CAIRO_FILL_RULE
	-- cairo_fill_rule_t is used to select how paths are filled. For
	-- both fill rules, whether or not a point is included in the fill
	-- is determined by taking a ray from that point to infinity and
	-- looking at intersections with the path. The ray can be in any
	-- direction, as long as it doesn't pass through the end point of a
	-- segment or have a tricky intersection such as intersecting
	-- tangent to the path. (Note that filling is not actually
	-- implemented in this way. This is just a description of the rule
	-- that is applied.)

	--   New entries may be added in future versions.
