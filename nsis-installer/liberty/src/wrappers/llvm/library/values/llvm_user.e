deferred class LLVM_USER
	-- Ancestor of constants, operators and instructions (and meta-database).

	-- The User class is the common base class of all LLVM nodes that may refer
	-- to Values. It exposes a list of "Operands" that are all of the Values
	-- that the User is referring to. The User class itself is a subclass of
	-- Value.

	-- The operands of a User point directly to the LLVM Value that it refers
	-- to. Because LLVM uses Static Single Assignment (SSA) form, there can
	-- only be one definition referred to, allowing this direct connection.
	-- This connection provides the use-def information in LLVM.

feature {ANY} -- TODO:Important Public Members of the User class
-- The User class exposes the operand list in two ways: through an index access interface and through an iterator based interface.
-- 
-- operand (an_index: NATURAL_32): LLVM_VALUE is Value *getOperand(unsigned i)
-- unsigned getNumOperands()
-- These two methods expose the operands of the User in a convenient form for direct access.
-- 
-- User::op_iterator - Typedef for iterator over the operand list
-- op_iterator op_begin() - Get an iterator to the start of the operand list.
-- op_iterator op_end() - Get an iterator to the end of the operand list.
-- Together, these methods make up the iterator based interface to the operands of a User.
end -- class LLVM_USER
