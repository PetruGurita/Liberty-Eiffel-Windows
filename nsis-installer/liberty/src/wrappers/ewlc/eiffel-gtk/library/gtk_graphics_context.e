class GTK_GRAPHICS_CONTEXT
	-- Graphics context picked from a shared pool of GdkGC
	-- objects. When a new GdkGC is needed, `make' is called with the
	-- required depth, colormap and GdkGCValues. If a GdkGC with the
	-- required properties already exists then that is returned. If
	-- not, a new GdkGC is created. When the GdkGC is no longer needed,
	-- `dispose' should be called.
