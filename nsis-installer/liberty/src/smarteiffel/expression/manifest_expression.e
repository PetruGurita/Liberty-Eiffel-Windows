deferred class MANIFEST_EXPRESSION
   --
   -- Common declaration type for all "obviously-static" manifest expressions. An obviously-static expression is an expression which
   -- cannot be changed because of some redefinition in a descendant and which is simple enough. Here are some obvious examples: 1,
   -- 2, True, False, 'a' or "foo". Note that even a simple expression like 1 + 1 is not considered as "obviously-static".
   --
   -- See `valid_manifest_expression_set' to have the exact list of allowed dynamic types (i.e. objects which are considered
   -- "obviously-static".
   --
   -- Actually, the purpose of this class is to have a more accurate declaration type mark for atomic and static manifest
   -- expressions. (Indeed, at some place, it is more accurate to use MANIFEST_EXPRESSION than simply EXPRESSION).
