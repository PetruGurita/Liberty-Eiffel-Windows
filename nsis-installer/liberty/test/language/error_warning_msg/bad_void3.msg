****** Warning: Actually, `Void' has no accurate type. Keep in
mind that `Void' is just a way to denote the default value for
a type or to denote the lack of an object. One can use `Void'
as the right-hand-side of an assignment or to replace some actual
argument. (See "http://wiki.liberty-eiffel.org/index.php/Void"
for details.) At time being, the type ANY will be used for this
occurrence `Void'. Please update your code with a more accurate
expression, may be by adding an extra non-initialized local variable.
