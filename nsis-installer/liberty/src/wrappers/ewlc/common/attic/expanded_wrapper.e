			-- The alloca() function allocates size bytes of space in the
			-- stack frame of the caller.  This temporary space is
			-- automatically freed when the function that called alloca()
			-- returns to its caller.
		
			-- The alloca() function returns a pointer to the beginning of
			-- the allocated space.  If the allocation causes stack
			-- overflow, program behavior is undefined.

			-- The alloca() function is machine- and compiler-dependent.
			-- For certain applications, its use can improve efficiency
			-- compared to the use of malloc(3) plus free(3).  In certain
			-- cases, it can also simplify memory deallocation in
			-- applications that use longjmp(3) or siglongjmp(3).
			-- Otherwise, its use is discouraged.
		
			-- Because the space allocated by alloca() is allocated
			-- within the stack frame, that space is automatically freed
			-- if the function return is jumped over by a call to
			-- longjmp(3) or siglongjmp(3).
