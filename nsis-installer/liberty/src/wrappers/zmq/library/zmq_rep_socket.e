class ZMQ_REP_SOCKET
        -- A ZMQ_REP socket that receives requests from and send replies to a client.

        -- It allows only an alternating sequence of request (receive) and and
        -- subsequent reply (send) commands. Each request received
        -- fair-queued from among all clients, and each reply sent is routed to
        -- the client that issued the last request. If the original requester
        -- doesnâ€™t exist any more the reply is silently discarded.

        -- When a ZMQ_REP socket enters an exceptional state due to having
        -- reached the high water mark for a client, then any replies sent to
        -- the client in question shall be dropped until the exceptional state
        -- ends.
