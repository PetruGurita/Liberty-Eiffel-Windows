class GTK_SEPARATOR_TOOL_ITEM
	-- A GTK_SEPARATOR_TOOL_ITEM is a GTK_TOOL_ITEM that separates
	-- groups of other GTK_TOOL_ITEMs. Depending on the theme, a
	-- GtkSeparatorToolItem will often look like a vertical line on
	-- horizontally docked toolbars.  If the property "expand" is True
	-- and the property "draw" is False, a GTK_SEPARATOR_TOOL_ITEM will
	-- act as a "spring" that forces other items to the ends of the
	-- toolbar.
