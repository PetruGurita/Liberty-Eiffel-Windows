deferred class ITERATOR[E_]
   --
   -- The iterator pattern at work: this abstract class defines a
   -- traversal interface for any kind of aggregates data structure.
   -- An iterator can be used when you need to do something on all
   -- elements in the data structure, but there is no order concept.
   --
   -- To create a new iterator, use `new_iterator' in the
   -- corresponding data structure.
   --
   -- See examples in directory tutorial/iterator.
