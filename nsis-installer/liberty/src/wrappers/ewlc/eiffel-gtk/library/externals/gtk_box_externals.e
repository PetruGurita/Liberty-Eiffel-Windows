-- -- TODO wrap the structure if necessary

-- typedef struct {
--   GList *children;
--   gint16 spacing;
--   guint homogeneous : 1;
-- } GtkBox;

-- The GtkBox-struct describes an instance of GtkBox and contains the following fields. (These fields should be considered read-only. They should never be set by an application.)
-- GList * children; 	a list of children belonging the GtkBox. The data is a list of structures of type GtkBoxChild-struct.
-- gint16 spacing; 	the number of pixels to put between children of the GtkBox, zero by default. Use gtk_box_set_spacing() to set this field.
-- guint homogeneous; 	a flag that if TRUE forces all children to get equal space in the GtkBox; FALSE by default. Use gtk_box_set_homogeneous() to set this field.

-- GtkBoxChild

-- typedef struct {
--   GtkWidget *widget;
--   guint16 padding;
--   guint expand : 1;
--   guint fill : 1;
--   guint pack : 1;
--   guint is_secondary : 1;
-- } GtkBoxChild;

-- The GtkBoxChild-struct holds a child widget of GtkBox and describes how the child is to be packed into the GtkBox. Use gtk_box_query_child_packing() and gtk_box_set_child_packing() to query and reset the padding, expand, fill, and pack fields.

-- GtkBoxChild-struct contains the following fields. (These fields should be considered read-only. They should never be directly set by an application.)
-- GtkWidget * widget; 	the child widget, packed into the GtkBox.
-- guint16 padding; 	the number of extra pixels to put between this child and its neighbors, set when packed, zero by default.
-- guint expand; 	flag indicates whether extra space should be given to this child. Any extra space given to the parent GtkBox is divided up among all children with this attribute set to TRUE; set when packed, TRUE by default.
-- guint fill; 	flag indicates whether any extra space given to this child due to its expand attribute being set is actually allocated to the child, rather than being used as padding around the widget; set when packed, TRUE by default.
-- guint pack; 	one of GtkPackType indicating whether the child is packed with reference to the start (top/left) or end (bottom/right) of the GtkBox.
