deferred class GTK_MISC
	-- The GtkMisc widget is an abstract widget which is not useful
	-- itself, but is used to derive subclasses which have alignment
	-- and padding attributes.

	-- The horizontal and vertical padding attributes allows extra
	-- space to be added around the widget.

	-- The horizontal and vertical alignment attributes enable the
	-- widget to be positioned within its allocated area. Note that if
	-- the widget is added to a container in such a way that it expands
	-- automatically to fill its allocated area, the alignment settings
	-- will not alter the widgets position.
