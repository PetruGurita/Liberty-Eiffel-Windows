			-- twice the signed area of the triangle defined by the three
			-- points. This function uses adaptive floating point
			-- arithmetic and is consequently geometrically robust.

			-- It is positive value if p1, p2 and p3 appear in
			-- counterclockwise order, a negative value if they appear in
			-- clockwise order and zero if they are colinear.

			-- the orientation is degenerate (i.e. p3 lies on the line
			-- defined by p1 and p2).

			-- counterclockwise order or a negative value if they appear
			-- in clockwise order.
