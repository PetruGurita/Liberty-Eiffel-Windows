deferred class GTK_TREE_DRAG_DEST
	-- GTK+ supports Drag-and-Drop in tree views with a high-level and
	-- a low-level API.
	
	-- The low-level API consists of the GTK+ DND API, augmented by
	-- some treeview utility functions: GTK_TREE_VIEW's
	-- set_drag_dest_row, get_drag_dest_row, get_dest_row_at_pos,
	-- create_row_drag_icon, set_row_drag_data and
	-- get_row_drag_data. This API leaves a lot of flexibility, but
	-- nothing is done automatically, and implementing advanced
	-- features like hover-to-open-rows or autoscrolling on top of this
	-- API is a lot of work.
	
	-- On the other hand, if you write to the high-level API, then all
	-- the bookkeeping of rows is done for you, as well as things like
	-- hover-to-open and auto-scroll, but your models have to implement
	-- the GtkTreeDragSource and GtkTreeDragDest interfaces.

inherit G_OBJECT
	
	-- Object Hierarchy: inherits from GInterface

	-- Known Implementations: GtkTreeDragSource is implemented by
	-- GtkTreeModelSort, GtkTreeStore, GtkListStore and
	-- GtkTreeModelFilter.

	-- GtkTreeDragDest is implemented by GtkTreeStore and GtkListStore.

This function can only be used if selection_data originates from the same process that's calling this function, because a pointer to the tree model is being passed around. If you aren't in the same process, then you'll get memory corruption. In the GtkTreeDragDest drag_data_received handler, you can assume that selection data of type GTK_TREE_MODEL_ROW is in from the current process. The returned path must be freed with gtk_tree_path_free().
