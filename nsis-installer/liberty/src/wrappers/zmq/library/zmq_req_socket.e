class ZMQ_REQ_SOCKET
        -- A socket that sends requests to and receives replies from a service.
        -- This socket type allows only an alternating sequence of request -
        -- sending a message - and subsequent reply - receiving an answer. Each
        -- request sent is load-balanced among all services, and each reply
        -- received is matched with the last issued request.

        -- When a ZMQ_REQ_SOCKET enters an exceptional state due to having reached
        -- the high water mark for all services, or if there are no services at
        -- all, then any send command on the socket shall block until the
        -- exceptional state ends or at least one service becomes available for
        -- sending; messages are not discarded.
