class GTK_HSEPARATOR
	-- The GtkHSeparator widget is a horizontal separator, used to
	-- group the widgets within a window. It displays a horizontal line
	-- with a shadow to make it appear sunken into the interface.

	-- Note: The GtkHSeparator widget is not used as a separator within
	-- menus. To create a separator in a menu create an empty
	-- GTK_SEPARATOR_MENU_ITEM widget and add it to the menu with
	-- GTK_MENU_SHELL.`append'.
