<a name="chap-2"/><h2>What does it do?</h2>
<div class="c2">
<p>That tutorial that shows how to solve problems 
sometimes called logigrams. The logigrams
are made of a set of items (persons, date, places, ...)
grouped into categories and set of true propositions 
about the items. From these propositions you must deduce
how the given items are combined together.</p>
<p>Here is an example:</p>
<p>That program solves the following classic problem.</p>
<p>Knowing that:</p>
<ul class="hyphen">
<li>
<p>the house of the english is red,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the spanish has a dog,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>one drink coffee in the green house,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the ukrainian drinks tea,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the green house is just at right of the ivory house,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the man that smokes winstons have a snail,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the man that smokes kools have the yellow house,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>one drinks milk in the house at the middle,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the norvegian lives in the house at left,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the one who smokes chesterfields is neibourgh of a fox,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the one who smokes kools is neibourgh of a horse,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the one who smokes luckystrike drinks orange juice,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the japanese smokes parliaments,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the norvegian is neibourgh of the blue house.</p>

<p><span class="exercice">Exercice:</span> write a program that solves any problem of the same kind.</p>
</div>
<a name="chap-3"/><h2>How does it work?</h2>
<div class="c2">
<p>It works in three steps:</p>
<ul class="hyphen">
<li>
<p>Creation of the problem description.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Transformation of the description to a <span class="class">AND</span>/<span class="class">OR</span> 
   tree of possible permutations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Exploration of the <span class="class">AND</span>/<span class="class">OR</span> tree by backtracking to
   retrieve the solutions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The main idea is to use permutations for retrieving the solutions.</p>
<a name="chap-3.1"/><h3>Description of the problem</h3>
<div class="c3">
<p>The description is managed with an object of the class <span class="class">DESCRIPTION</span>
that mainly contains:</p>
<ul class="hyphen">
<li>
<p>a set of groups;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a set of constraints through an object of class <span class="class">CONSTRAINT_SET</span>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>First of all, the groups must be declared. There are 3 kind of
groups:</p>
<ul class="hyphen">
<li>
<p>the atomic groups;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the ordered groups what means that the order of the items
   of the group cares and that each item receive a number that
   is its place, beginning to zero;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the numeric groups that must contain numeric items.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The groups are all managed through objects of class <span class="class">GROUP</span>.</p>
<p>The constraints (class <span class="class">CONSTRAINT</span>) are distinguished in two 
types: </p>
<ul class="hyphen">
<li>
<p>Constraints on couples (class <span class="class">CONSTRAINT_COUPLE</span> association of a 
   couple of two items that are not of the same group), that comprises:</p>
</li>
<ul class="hyphen">
<li>
<p>positive association of a couple (class <span class="class">CONSTRAINT_YES</span>) what meaning
       is that the 2 items are associated together (example: marie had 
       4 children);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>negative association of a couple (class <span class="class">CONSTRAINT_NO</span>) what meaning
       is that the 2 items are never associated together (example: marie 
       didn't have 4 children).</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Logical constraints (class <span class="class">CONSTRAINT_LOGICAL</span>) that currently only are 
   the relationnal constraints (class <span class="class">CONSTRAINT_RELATIONAL</span>) on some integer 
   expressions, that comprises equal, greater, lesser, and 
   not equal, from the classes <span class="class">CONSTRAINT_EQUAL</span>, <span class="class">CONSTRAINT_GREATER</span>, 
   <span class="class">CONSTRAINT_LESSER</span>, <span class="class">CONSTRAINT_NOT_EQUAL</span>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The relational constraints are on expressions that are built using 
inheriters of class <span class="class">EXPR</span>, say:</p>
<ul class="hyphen">
<li>
<p>constants from <span class="class">EXPR_VALUE</span>;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>addition, substraction, multiplication from <span class="class">EXPR_ADD</span>, <span class="class">EXPR_SUB</span>
   and <span class="class">EXPR_MUL</span>;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>absolute value from <span class="class">EXPR_ABS</span>;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the conversion from an item to an integer (possible only for items
   of numeric or ordered groups) with <span class="class">EXPR_ITEM</span>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The constraints on couple take 2 items and the item expression take 
one item. In any of these cases, items can be or true items (<span class="class">ITEM_ITEM</span>)
or variable items (<span class="class">ITEM_VAR</span>). A variable is attached to a group and can
take any value into it.</p>
<p>The description is built by putting constraints into the the constraint
set. The constraints set records the constraint in several groups of 
bound constraints. Two constraints are bound together if they share the
same variable. The class <span class="class">ITEM_COLLECTOR</span> serves the purpose of enumerating
the items of a constraint.</p>
<p>Such a binding relation define equivalent classes that are 
used to group the constraints together into <span class="class">CONSTRAINT_GROUP</span>. 
At the end of the description the constraint set contains</p>
<ul class="hyphen">
<li>
<p>an unbound constraint group that does not depend on any variables;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a list of constraint groups that have variables such that any
   pair of group in the list have a separate set of variables.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="exercice">Exercice:</span> add some new logical operators like and, or, ...</p>
</div>
<a name="chap-3.2"/><h3>Transformation of the description</h3>
<div class="c3">
<p>In that step, the constraints are transformed to a <span class="class">AND</span>/<span class="class">OR</span>
tree of the possible permutations.</p>
<p>The possible permutations are recorded using a <span class="class">BIT_STRING</span>.
Here is how.</p>
<p>Let get two groups: A and X. 
The group A is made of the item a, b, c.
The group X is made of the item x, y, z.
The possible permutations from A and X are
listed below:
<pre>
   +-----+-----------+---------+
   |  A  | a | b | c |  number |
   +-----+---+---+---+---------+
   |     | x | y | z |    0    |
   |     | x | z | y |    1    |
   |  X  | y | x | z |    2    |
   |     | y | z | x |    3    |
   |     | z | x | y |    4    |
   |     | z | y | x |    5    |
   +-----+---+---+---+---------+
</pre>
Each of these permutation have received a number that identifies
it. That number is used for the <span class="class">BIT_STRING</span> indexes.</p>
<p>For example, the possible permutations where b is associated
with z are the ones of number 1 and 3 then the corresponding
bit string value is:
<pre>
     index: 0 1 2 3 4 5
     value: 0 1 0 1 0 0
</pre></p>
<p>For example, the possible permutations where c is not associated
with y are the ones of number 0, 2, 3, 5 and 3 then the corresponding
bit string value is:
<pre>
     index: 0 1 2 3 4 5
     value: 1 0 1 1 0 1
</pre></p>
<p>So if the problem is to find how to arrange A with X in a such
way that b is with z and c is not with y, a sample or between the
possible combinations gives the solution:
<pre>
              index: 0 1 2 3 4 5</p>
<p>(P1)       b with x: 0 1 0 1 0 0
(P2)   c not with y: 1 0 1 1 0 1
                    -------------
      (P1) and (P2): 0 0 0 1 0 0
</pre>
The solution is permutation 3: a with y, b with z, c with x.</p>
<p>For N groups, the program manages (N * (N-1))/2 pair of 
possible permutations.</p>
<p>The <span class="class">AND</span>/<span class="class">OR</span> tree is created by <span class="class">CONSTRAINT_SET</span> that simply make
a and of the sub trees created by each of the group of constraint
<span class="class">CONSTRAINT_GROUP</span> it contains.</p>
<p>The <span class="class">CONSTRAINT_GROUP</span> enumerate all possible combination of 
the variables and when a combination is consistent for the
set of logical constraints, it generates a <span class="class">AND</span> list of the
possible permutations that the combination represent. 
The result is a <span class="class">OR</span> of all the detected possibilities.</p>
<p>The masks are built by using an instance of <span class="class">MASK_BUILDER</span>.</p>
<p><span class="exercice">Exercice:</span> explain how permutations are numbered.</p>
<p><span class="exercice">Exercice:</span> try to improve the time used for the transformation by
challenging the variables before each invocation of 'get_node'
in 'get_node_of_var', class <span class="class">CONSTRAINT_GROUP</span>. Trick: add a deferred
feature 'can_challenge' in <span class="class">CONSTRAINT_LOGICAL</span>.</p>
</div>
<a name="chap-3.3"/><h3>Exploration of the solutions</h3>
<div class="c3">
<p>During this step, the possible combinations of the <span class="class">AND</span>/<span class="class">OR</span> tre are 
enumerated using the <span class="class">BACKTRACKING</span> behaviors. When a solution is
possible, it is checked to see if it is consistent. In effect,
it is not possible to detect all impossibilities during the
exploration.</p>
<p>The class <span class="class">SITUATION</span> is used to do all that stuff.</p>
<p><span class="exercice">Exercice:</span> try to improve the checking of the consistency of the 
presumed solutions. You wil find it in class <span class="class">SITUATION</span>, the feature
is 'try_solution'.</p>
