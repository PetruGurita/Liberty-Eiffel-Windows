class GTK_TARGET_ENTRY
	--	A GtkTargetEntry structure represents a single type of data than
	--	can be supplied for by a widget for a selection or for supplied
	--	or received during drag-and-drop. It contains a string
	--	representing the drag type, a flags field (used only for drag
	--	and drop - see GtkTargetFlags), and an application assigned
	--	integer ID. The integer ID will later be passed as a signal
	--	parameter for signals like %"selection_get%".  It allows the
	--	application to identify the target type without extensive string
	--	compares.

	-- typedef struct {
	--   gchar *target;
	--   guint  flags;
	--   guint  info;
