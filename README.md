# Liberty-Eiffel-Windows

I created a working version of Liberty on windows environment, expect for few tools that make use of net plugin (which is not fixed yet) + a windows installer (I will post a download link soon).
The next two steps :
Use the tests from /test to test the accuracy of the compiler.
Fix net plugin.
