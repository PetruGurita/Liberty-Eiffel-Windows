class ZMQ_PUB_SOCKET
        -- A socket of type ZMQ_PUB is used by a publisher to distribute data.
        -- Messages sent are distributed in a fan out fashion to all connected
        -- peers.

        -- When a ZMQ_PUB socket enters an exceptional state due to having reached
        -- the high water mark for a subscriber, then any messages that would be
        -- sent to the subscriber in question shall instead be dropped until the
        -- exceptional state ends. The zmq_send() function shall never block for
        -- this socket type.
