class GTK_CELL_RENDERER_COMBO
	-- GTK_CELL_RENDERER_COMBO renders text in a cell like
	-- GTK_CELL_RENDERER_TEXT from which it is derived. But while
	-- GTK_CELL_RENDERER_TEXT offers a simple entry to edit the text,
	-- GTK_CELL_RENDERER_COMBO offers a GTK_COMBO_BOX or
	-- GTK_COMBO_BOX_ENTRY widget to edit the text. The values to
	-- display in the combo box are taken from the tree model specified
	-- in the model property.

	-- The combo cell renderer takes care of adding a text cell
	-- renderer to the combo box and sets it to display the column
	-- specified by its text-column property. Further cell renderers
	-- can be added in a handler for the editing-started signal.

			-- property on the cell renderer to a string value in the
			-- model, thus rendering a different string in each row of

-- The "model" property

--   "model"                GtkTreeModel          : Read / Write

-- Holds a tree model containing the possible values for the combo box. Use the text_column property to specify the column holding the values.

-- Since 2.6
-- The "text-column" property

--   "text-column"          gint                  : Read / Write

-- Specifies the model column which holds the possible values for the combo box. Note that this refers to the model specified in the model property, not the model backing the tree view to which this cell renderer is attached.

-- GtkCellRendererCombo automatically adds a text cell renderer for this column to its combo box.

-- Allowed values: >= -1

-- Default value: -1

-- Since 2.6
