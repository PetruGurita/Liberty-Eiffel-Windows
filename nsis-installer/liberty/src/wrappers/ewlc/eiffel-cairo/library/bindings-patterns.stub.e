	--Patterns
	--
	--   The cairo C API allows for creating a number of different types of
	--   patterns. All of these different types of patterns map to cairo_pattern_t
	--   in C, but in an object oriented language, there should instead be a
	--   hierarchy of types. (The functions that should map to constructors for the
	--   various types are listed after the type, methods on that type are listed
	--   below)
	--
	-- cairo_pattern_t
	--       cairo_pattern_set_matrix()
	--       cairo_pattern_get_matrix()
	--    cairo_solid_pattern_t
	--    cairo_surface_pattern_t (cairo_pattern_create_for_surface())
	--          cairo_pattern_set_extend()
