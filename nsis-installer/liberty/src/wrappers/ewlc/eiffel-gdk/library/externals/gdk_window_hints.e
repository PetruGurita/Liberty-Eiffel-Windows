deferred class GDK_WINDOW_HINTS
	-- Used to indicate which fields of a GdkGeometry struct should be
	-- paid attention to. Also, the presence/absence of `gdk_hint_pos',
	-- `gdk_hint_user_pos', and `gdk_hint_user_size' is significant,
	-- though they don't directly refer to `GDK_GEOMETRY_STRUCT' (TODO)
	-- fields. `gdk_hint_user_pos' will be set automatically by
	-- GtkWindow if you call GTK_WINDOW's `move'. `gdk_hint_user_pos'
	-- and `gdk_hint_user_size' should be set if the user specified a
	-- size/position using a --geometry command-line argument;
	-- GTK_WINDOW's `parse_geometry' (TODO) automatically sets these
	-- flags.
