****** Fatal Error: The old "select" option of the "inherit" clause
is now obsolete. You have to update your code with the new "insert"
mechanism. With Liberty Eiffel, this can be achieved thanks to
the new "insert" clause. The new "insert" clause comes just after
the traditional "inherit" clause with a similar syntax.
