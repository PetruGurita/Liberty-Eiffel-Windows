deferred class GTK_TREE_DRAG_SOURCE
	-- GTK+ supports Drag-and-Drop in tree views with a high-level and
	-- a low-level API.
	
	-- The low-level API consists of the GTK+ DND API, augmented by
	-- some treeview utility functions, wrapped into GTK_TREE_VIEW:
	-- set_drag_dest_row, get_drag_dest_row, get_dest_row_at_pos,
	-- create_row_drag_icon, _set_row_drag_data() and
	-- gtk_tree_get_row_drag_data(). This API leaves a lot of
	-- flexibility, but nothing is done automatically, and implementing
	-- advanced features like hover-to-open-rows or autoscrolling on
	-- top of this API is a lot of work.
	
	-- On the other hand, if you write to the high-level API, then all
	-- the bookkeeping of rows is done for you, as well as things like
	-- hover-to-open and auto-scroll, but your models have to implement
	-- the GtkTreeDragSource and GtkTreeDragDest interfaces.

	-- originates from the same process that's calling this function,
	-- because a pointer to the tree model is being passed around. If
	-- you aren't in the same process, then you'll get memory
	-- corruption. In the GtkTreeDragDest drag_data_received handler,
