			-- This function must be the first function to call, and it returns a CURL
			-- easy handle that you must use as input to other easy-functions.
			-- curl_easy_init initializes curl and this call MUST have a corresponding
			-- call to curl_easy_cleanup(3) when the operation is complete.
			-- 
			-- If you did not already call curl_global_init(3), curl_easy_init(3) does
			-- it automatically. This may be lethal in multi-threaded cases, since
			-- curl_global_init(3) is not thread-safe, and it may result in resource
			-- problems because there is no corresponding cleanup.
			-- 
			-- You are strongly advised to not allow this automatic behaviour, by
			-- calling curl_global_init(3) yourself properly. See the description in
			-- libcurl(3) of global environment requirements for details of how to use
			-- this function.

			-- This will effectively close all connections this handle has used and
			-- possibly has kept open until now. Don't call this function if you intend
			-- to transfer more files.

			-- When you've called this, you can safely remove all the strings you've
			-- previously told libcurl to use, as it won't use them anymore now.

			-- faster, less CPU intense and using less network resources. Just note
			-- that you will have to use curl_easy_setopt(3) between the invokes to set
			-- options for the following curl_easy_perform.
			-- 
			-- You must never call this function simultaneously from two places using
			-- the same handle. Let the function return first before invoking it
			-- another time. If you want parallel transfers, you must use several curl
			-- handles.
			-- 
			-- RETURN VALUE: 0 means everything was ok, non-zero means an error
			-- occurred as <curl/curl.h> defines. If the CURLOPT_ERRORBUFFER was set
			-- with curl_easy_setopt there will be a readable error message in the
			-- error buffer when non-zero is returned.
