	-- its own window. It is useful since it allows you to catch events
	-- for widgets which do not have their own window.

	set_above_child(above: BOOLEAN) is
			-- Set whether the event box window is positioned above the
			-- windows of its child, as opposed to below it. If the
			-- window is above, all events inside the event box will
			-- go to the event box. If the window is below, events in
			-- windows of child widgets will first got to that widget,
			-- and then to its parents.
			--
			-- The default is to keep the window below the child.
		do
			gtk_event_box_set_above_child(handle, above.to_integer)
		end

	above_child: BOOLEAN is
			-- Returns whether the event box window is above or below
			-- the windows of its child. See set_above_child() for details.
		do
			Result := gtk_event_box_get_above_child (handle).to_boolean
		end

	set_visible_window (a_visible: BOOLEAN) is
			-- Set whether the event box uses a visible or invisible child
			-- window. The default is to use visible windows.
			--
			-- In an invisible window event box, the window that that the
			-- event box creates is a GDK_INPUT_ONLY window, which means
			-- that it is invisible and only serves to receive events.
			--
			-- A visible window event box creates a visible (GDK_INPUT_OUTPUT)
			-- window that acts as the parent window for all the widgets
			-- contained in the event box.
			--
			-- You should generally make your event box invisible if you
			-- just want to trap events. Creating a visible window may
			-- cause artifacts that are visible to the user, especially
			-- if the user is using a theme with gradients or pixmaps.
			--
			-- The main reason to create a non input-only event box is if
			-- you want to set the background to a different color or draw
			-- on it.
			--
			-- Note: There is one unexpected issue for an invisible event
			-- box that has its window below the child. (See set_above_child)
			-- Since the input-only window is not an ancestor window of any
			-- windows that descendent widgets of the event box create,
			-- events on these windows aren't propagated up by the windowing
			-- system, but only by GTK+. The practical effect of this is if
			-- an event isn't in the event mask for the descendant window
			-- (add_events()), it won't be received by the event box.
			--
			-- This problem doesn't occur for visible event boxes, because
			-- in that case, the event box window is actually the ancestor
			-- of the descendant windows, not just at the same place on the
			-- screen.

			gtk_event_box_set_visible_window(handle, a_visible.to_integer)
