	-- A data structure for holding a path. This data structure serves

	-- cairo_append_path().

	-- See cairo_path_data_t for hints on how to iterate over the
	-- actual data within the path.

	-- The num_data member gives the number of elements in the data
	-- array. This number is larger than the number of independent path
	-- portions (defined in cairo_path_data_type_t), since the data
	-- includes both headers and coordinates for each portion.
