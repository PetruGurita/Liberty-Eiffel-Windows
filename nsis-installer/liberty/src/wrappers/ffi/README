Libffi, a portable foreign-function interface library.

Manual page says: "The foreign function interface provides a mechanism by which
a function can generate a call to another function at runtime without requiring
knowledge of the called function's interface at compile time."

This library allow the Liberty interpreter to invoke arbitrary functions at
runtime, i.e. plugins given in input.
