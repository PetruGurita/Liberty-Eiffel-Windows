class GTK_TOOLTIPS
	-- Tooltips are the messages that appear next to a widget when the mouse
	-- pointer is held over it for a short amount of time. They are especially
	-- helpful for adding more verbose descriptions of things such as buttons
	-- in a toolbar.
	
	-- An individual tooltip belongs to a group of tooltips. A group is created
	-- with a creation call to make. Every tooltip in the group can then be
	-- turned off with a call to disable() and enabled with enable().
	
	-- The length of time the user must keep the mouse over a widget before the
	-- tip is shown, can be altered with set_delay(). This is set on a
	-- 'per group of tooltips' basis.
	
	-- To assign a tip to a particular GTK_WIDGET, set_tip() is used.
	
	-- Note:
	
	-- Tooltips can only be set on widgets which have their own X window and
	-- receive enter and leave events. To check if a widget has its own window
	-- use GTK_WIDGET_NO_WINDOW(). To add a tooltip to a widget that doesn't
	-- have its own window, place the widget inside a GTK_EVENT_BOX and add a
	-- tooltip to that instead.
	
	-- The default appearance of all tooltips in a program is determined by the
	-- current GTK+ theme that the user has selected.
	
	-- Information about the tooltip (if any) associated with an arbitrary
	-- widget can be retrieved using data_get().
