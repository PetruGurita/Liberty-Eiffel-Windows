class GTK_CELL_RENDERER_PIXBUF
	-- A GTK_CELL_RENDERER_PIXBUF can be used to render an image in a
	-- cell. It allows to render either a given GDK_PIXBUF (set via the
	-- pixbuf property) or a stock icon (set via the stock-id
	-- property).

	-- To support the tree view, GTK_CELL_RENDERER_PIXBUF also supports
	-- rendering two alternative pixbufs, when the is-expander property
	-- is TRUE. If the is-expanded property is TRUE and the
	-- pixbuf-expander-open property is set to a pixbuf, it renders
	-- that pixbuf, if the is-expanded property is FALSE and the
	-- pixbuf-expander-closed property is set to a pixbuf, it renders
	-- that one.

			-- property on the cell renderer to a pixbuf value in the
			-- model, thus rendering a different image in each row of the
			-- GtkTreeView.
