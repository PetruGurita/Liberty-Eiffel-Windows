-- Creates a new timeout source.

-- The source will not initially be associated with any GMainContext and must be added to one with g_source_attach() before it will be executed.

-- interval : 	the timeout interval in milliseconds.
-- Returns : 	the newly-created timeout source

-- Sets a function to be called at regular intervals, with the given priority. The function is called repeatedly until it returns FALSE, at which point the timeout is automatically destroyed and the function will not be called again. The notify function is called when the timeout is destroyed. The first call to the function will be at the end of the first interval.

-- Note that timeout functions may be delayed, due to the processing of other event sources. Thus they should not be relied on for precise timing. After each call to the timeout function, the time of the next timeout is recalculated based on the current time and the given interval (it does not try to 'catch up' time lost in delays).

-- priority : 	the priority of the idle source. Typically this will be in the range between G_PRIORITY_DEFAULT_IDLE and G_PRIORITY_HIGH_IDLE.
-- interval : 	the time between calls to the function, in milliseconds (1/1000ths of a second)
-- function : 	function to call
-- data : 	data to pass to function
-- notify : 	function to call when the idle is removed, or NULL
-- Returns : 	the id of event source.
