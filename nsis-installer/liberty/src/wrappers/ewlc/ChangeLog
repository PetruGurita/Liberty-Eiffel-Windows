2006-08-22  Paolo Redaelli  <tybor@gna.org>

	* eiffel-gobject/library/g_value.e: Adding support for float (REAL_32)

	* eiffel-gtk/library/gtk_scrollbar.e: Wrapping horizontal and vertical scrollbar

2006-08-20  Paolo Redaelli  <tybor@gna.org>

	* eiffel-gtk/library/gtk_main.e: Simulating once call in initialize

	* eiffel-gtk/examples/tree/tree_demo.e: Using GTK instead of GTK_MAIN

	* eiffel-gdk/library/gdk_drawable.e: Made GDK_DRAWABLE deferred.

	* common/wrapper.e: Removed `Null' feature, which was just
	syntactic sugar for programmers addicted to C. Use
	`default_pointer' instead. Moved address_of and content_of
	features into POINTER_HANDLING class; they're used in GTK_MAIN
	which is not a WRAPPER.

	* eiffel-gtk/library/gtk_main.e: Adding global-window-related features

	* eiffel-glib/library/data_types/g_slist.e: Merged add_first and
	prepend features. Merged add_last and append.

2006-08-19  Paolo Redaelli  <tybor@gna.org>

	* eiffel-glib/library/data_types/g_error.e: Inserted the full
	description found in GLib documentation. It is still to be fully
	Eiffellized.

	* eiffel-gtk/library/gtk_font_selection_dialog.e: Fully implemented it.

	* eiffel-gtk/library/gtk_toggle_action.e: Adding strings
	preconditions.

	* eiffel-gtk/library/gtk_toggle_button.e: Added precondition for
	the string passed to with_label, with_mnemonic creation clauses.

	* eiffel-gobject_library/g_object.e: put an explaning label to the
	most elaborated precondition of from_external_pointer

	* Adding gtk.is_initialized preconditions to each creation clause
	of GTK+ effective classes.

	* eiffel-gtk/library/gtk_object.e: some clean-up; inserting GTK
	class

2006-08-17  Paolo Redaelli  <tybor@gna.org>

	* In all GTK+ G_OBJECT's heirs changed the code pattern "handle :=
	gtk_foo_bar; store_eiffel_wrapper" into
	"from_external_pointer (gtk_foo_bar)", that automatically store
	the Eiffel object into the underlying GObject.

	* common/shared_c_struct.e: Removed "undefine make". The idea is
	that some C library could require the end-user to allocate some
	structures passed to it.

	* eiffel-gtk/library/gtk_frame.e: Removed wrong inheriting from
	SHARED_C_STRUCT. GTK_BIN already inherits from it.

	* all GTK+ classes: classes providing external calls,
	enumerations, flags, low-level implementation such as object
	retrieving from the underlying GObject struct are now (more
	properly AFAIK) inserted instead of inherited.

	* Adding struct_size to every GTK+ class

2006-08-16  Paolo Redaelli  <tybor@gna.org>

	* Fixed some documentation in GTK_TREE_STORE

2006-08-15  Paolo Redaelli  <paolo@localhost>

	* g_object.e: changed "feature {NONE}" into "feature {}" to avoid
		      all the warnings with SmartEiffel 2.3 					 

	* Added GTK_SCROLLED_WINDOW

2006-08-15  Paolo Redaelli  <tybor@gna.org>

	* changed "feature {NONE}" into "feature {}" to avoid all the
	warnings with SmartEiffel 2.3

	* Added GTK_SCROLLED_WINDOW

	* Added GTK_STANDARD_ENUMERATIONS than inserts all the existing
		GTK enums and implements all the missing one.

	* Added GTK_WRAP_MODE, needed in GTK_TEXT_BUFFER
