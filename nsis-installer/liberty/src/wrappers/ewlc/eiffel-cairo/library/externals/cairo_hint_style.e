deferred class CAIRO_HINT_STYLE
	-- Specifies the type of hinting to do on font outlines. Hinting is
	-- the process of fitting outlines to the pixel grid in order to
	-- improve the appearance of the result. Since hinting outlines
	-- involves distorting them, it also reduces the faithfulness to
	-- the original outline shapes. Not all of the outline hinting
	-- styles are supported by all font backends.

	--   New entries may be added in future versions.
