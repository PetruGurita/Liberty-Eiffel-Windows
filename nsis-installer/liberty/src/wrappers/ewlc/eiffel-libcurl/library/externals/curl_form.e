			-- need to keep it around after this function call. If the data isn't null
			-- terminated, or if you'd like it to contain zero bytes, you must set the
			-- length of the name with CURLFORM_CONTENTSLENGTH. The copied data will be

		external "C macro use <curl/curl.h>"
		alias "CURLFORM_FILECONTENT"

	curl_form_file: INTEGER is
			-- followed by a filename, makes this part a file upload part. It sets the
			-- filename field to the basename of the provided filename, it reads the
			-- contents of the file and passes them as data and sets the content-type
			-- if the given file match one of the internally known file extensions. For
			-- CURLFORM_FILE the user may send one or more files in one part by
			-- providing multiple CURLFORM_FILE arguments each followed by the filename
			-- (and each CURLFORM_FILE is allowed to have a CURLFORM_CONTENTTYPE).

			-- is used in combination with CURLFORM_FILE. Followed by a pointer to a
			-- string which provides the content-type for this part, possibly instead
			-- of an internally chosen one.
		external "C macro use <curl/curl.h>"
		alias "CURLFORM_CONTENTTYPE"
		end

	curl_form_file_name: INTEGER is
			-- is used in combination with CURLFORM_FILE. Followed by a pointer to a
			-- string, it tells libcurl to use the given string as the filename in the
			-- file upload part instead of the actual file name.

			-- CURLFORM_BUFFER
			-- 
			-- is used for custom file upload parts without use of CURLFORM_FILE. It
			-- tells libcurl that the file contents are already present in a buffer.
			-- The parameter is a string which provides the filename field in the
			-- content header.
			-- 
			-- CURLFORM_BUFFERPTR
			-- 
			-- is used in combination with CURLFORM_BUFFER. The parameter is a pointer
			-- to the buffer to be uploaded. This buffer must not be freed until after
			-- curl_easy_cleanup(3) is called. You must also use CURLFORM_BUFFERLENGTH
			-- to set the number of bytes in the buffer.
			-- 
			-- CURLFORM_BUFFERLENGTH
			-- 
			-- is used in combination with CURLFORM_BUFFER. The parameter is a long
			-- which gives the length of the buffer.
			-- 
			-- CURLFORM_ARRAY
			-- 
			-- Another possibility to send options to curl_formadd() is the
			-- CURLFORM_ARRAY option, that passes a struct curl_forms array pointer as
			-- its value. Each curl_forms structure element has a CURLformoption and a
			-- char pointer. The final element in the array must be a CURLFORM_END. All
			-- available options can be used in an array, except the CURLFORM_ARRAY
			-- option itself! The last argument in such an array must always be
			-- CURLFORM_END.
			-- 
			-- CURLFORM_CONTENTHEADER
			-- 
			-- specifies extra headers for the form POST section. This takes a
			-- curl_slist prepared in the usual way using curl_slist_append and appends
			-- the list of headers to those libcurl automatically generates. The list
			-- must exist while the POST occurs, if you free it before the post
			-- completes you may experience problems.
			-- 
			-- When you've passed the HttpPost pointer to curl_easy_setopt(3) (using
			-- the CURLOPT_HTTPPOST option), you must not free the list until after
			-- you've called curl_easy_cleanup(3) for the curl handle.
